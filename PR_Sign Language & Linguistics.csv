Wh-doubling in German Sign Language",Why not sluicing?,2023,"

Wh-doubling is a widely attested phenomenon in sign languages. Several analyses are found in the
                    literature assuming, for example, base-generation of one of the doubles or making (heavy) use of remnant movement. Using data from
                    German Sign Language, this article discusses the possibility that the structure might be derived from a relative clause embedded
                    under a wh-question which finally undergoes sluicing. It will be argued that such an account correctly predicts
                    the distribution of the wh-phrases found in German Sign Language doubling constructions.

", ,2023,"
This study explores word order patterns produced by deaf students who use Israeli Sign Language (ISL) and Arabic.
                    Nineteen students participated in a sentence elicitation task in which they retold events portrayed in 24 short videos in three
                    language conditions: signed ISL, spoken Palestinian Arabic and written Modern Standard Arabic. A control group of 19 hearing
                    students was tested in the two Arabic conditions. Results showed that SVO word order was the most frequent in both groups, and in
                    all three languages. SOV word order, which is common in ISL but ungrammatical in Arabic, was produced only by the deaf group.
                    Finally, unique word orders, specific to the signed modality were produced only in the ISL condition. The findings suggest that
                    deaf students are sensitive to the syntactic structures of each language they use and show natural cross-linguistic interaction in
                    their language use.

How do new words arise in a sign language? We present an empirical study of newly formed words in Sign Language of
					the Netherlands (NGT). Five signers were asked to create new forms for known concepts for which word forms exist in NGT.
					Participants used sequential strategies for word formation, also found in spoken languages. More frequently, however, they used
					simultaneous strategies, some of which are unique for the visual-manual modality. We describe and discuss each strategy and focus
					on the most prominent of these, namely the simultaneous combination of meaningful form elements (Form-Meaning Units or FMUs). The
					abundance of simultaneous combinations of FMUs in our data cannot be explained in terms of concatenative morphology. We propose an
					account for word formation phenomena in NGT that uses the phonological segment as the template for simultaneous combinations of
					FMUs. This study shows that the FMUs function as basic building blocks for words and accordingly can be considered morphemes.
					Given the large set of FMUs in NGT and their frequent occurrence in the newly formed lexical words in our data, we argue for the
					acknowledgement of more morphological complexity within the lexicon of sign languages and for a re-evaluation of the relation
					between sign language phonology, morphology, and syntax.

10.1075/sll.21005.khr,Evgeniia Khristoforova,Subject agreement in control and modal constructions in Russian Sign Language,Implications for the hierarchy of person features,2023,"
The present research combines three fields of inquiry in sign language linguistics: verbal agreement, person features, and syntactic complexity. These topics have previously been addressed in isolation, but little is known about their interaction. This study attempts to fill this gap by investigating subject agreement in complement clauses in Russian Sign Language. By means of corpus investigation and grammaticality judgments, I found that subject agreement in clausal complements of the control predicates try, love, want, begin, and modal can may be deficient – in particular, it can be reduced to the forms identical to first-person marking even in the case of a third-person subject controller. Deficient subject agreement in complement clauses is thus reminiscent of non-finite verbal forms in spoken languages. I further argue that the choice of first-person forms in deficient agreement reveals a default status of first person in sign languages, which is consistent with proposals regarding the modality-specific properties of first-person reference in these languages.

					Language", ,2023,"
Anaphoric pronoun resolution in spoken language has been shown to be influenced by the first mention bias. While
					this bias has been well investigated in spoken languages, less is known about a similar bias in sign languages. In sign languages,
					pronominal pointing signs (index) are directed towards referential locations in the signing space typically associated with
					discourse referents. In German Sign Language (DGS), signers follow an ipsi-contralateral default pattern while tracking referents,
					i.e., the first referent is associated with the ipsilateral and the second referent with the contralateral area of the signing
					space. Hence, directing a pronoun to either the ipsi- or the contralateral side of the signing space refers to either the first or
					the second discourse referent. The present event-related potential study reanalyzes the data from Wienholz et al. (2018) and examines the first mention effect during pronoun resolution in ambiguous
					contexts in DGS. The original study presented participants with sentence sets containing two referents without overt localization
					in the first and a sentence-initial pronominal index sign in the second sentence directed to either the ipsilateral or
					contralateral side of the signing space. Based on the direction of the index sign, our analysis reveals an N400 for contralateral
					index signs suggesting increased processing costs triggered by a violation of the first mention effect. Thus, the current study
					provides first experimental evidence for a first mention effect in DGS and highlights the modality-independent nature of this
					effect.

This study investigates differences in language production of native, early-learner, and late-learner Turkish Sign Language (Türk İşaret Dili – TİD) signers in the domain of classifiers. For this study, we conducted a picture-signing task to elicit clauses with classifier constructions from adult Deaf signers of these three groups. The results indicate that there is no significant difference among these three groups with respect to the morphological encoding of thematic roles on verbal roots in classifier constructions. Nonetheless, a difference surfaces in the argument expression patterns among these groups. The data show that the age of exposure to a first linguistic input impacts the argument expression rates as well as which arguments are expressed or left unexpressed. Native signers drop the agent argument more frequently than early-learner and late-learner signers. Early-learner signers, in turn, drop the agent argument more frequently than late-learners. The data further indicate that perspective taking interacts with argument expression and age of acquisition. Overall, signers drop the agent more frequently under a character perspective than an observer perspective, with native and early-learner signers employing this strategy more than late-learner signers.

The present study investigates the effects of late sign language exposure on narrative development in Turkish Sign
                    Language (TİD) by focusing on the introductions of main characters and the linguistic strategies used in these introductions. We
                    study these domains by comparing narrations produced by native and late signers in TİD. The results of our study reveal that late
                    sign language exposure does not hinder the acquisition of linguistic devices to introduce main characters in narrations. Thus, their
                    acquisition seems to be resilient to the effects of late language exposure. Our study further suggests that a two-year exposure to
                    sign language facilitates the acquisition of these skills in signing children even in the case of late language exposure, thus
                    providing further support for the importance of sign language exposure to develop linguistic skills for signing children.

Syntactic processes trigger changes in the movement-parameter of Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) numeral signs. Though HKSL cardinal numerals by default do not contain movement and are produced in neutral space, under specific circumstances, the movement-parameter can be altered from [∅] to specifications for both path- and hand-internal movement. This creates four types of numerals: (1) event numerals, (2) transfer numerals, (3) conjunction numerals, and (4) list numerals. I analyze the syntactic structures of these four numerals as follows: Firstly, event numerals quantify the number of times an event denoted by V has occurred and in syntax the numeral is located in a FreqP in Spec,VP. Secondly, transfer numerals show transfer of ownership and are within the DP complement of V0. Thirdly, the conjunction numeral indicates that all items of a set are included and the numeral is located within ConjP. Finally, the list numeral is the head of a NumeP with a [list]-feature within DP.

While there are several analyses of negation in American Sign Language (ASL), the phenomenon of negative incorporation has been overlooked in the generative literature, except for Sandler’s (1999) phonological analysis. The phonological approach makes several useful generalizations but is not without its drawbacks. We, therefore, situate our analysis in the Distributed Morphology framework and argue that negative incorporation is best analyzed as a case of negative suppletion. We motivate our approach based on the observations that (i) negative incorporation is sentential negation, (ii) negative incorporation blocks the occurrence of the canonical negation strategy for the affected verbs, and (iii) there is no verb-to-Neg movement in ASL. When taken together, these factors indicate that negative incorporation cannot be affixation. Suppletion, however, alleviates the problematic aspects of the phonological analysis while maintaining the relevant phonological generalizations.

This paper investigates content questions and the paradigm of question words in Czech Sign Language (český znakový jazyk – ČZJ). While this topic has been investigated for a fair number of other sign languages, a comprehensive study for ČZJ is still missing. Our aim is to fill this gap. In the absence of a representative corpus for ČZJ, we use data from the most extensive electronic dictionary database (Dictio), developed at the Masaryk University in Brno. We offer a basic description of the ČZJ interrogative strategies for content questions. In doing so, we also situate the language within the typology of sign language interrogatives: we classify ČZJ as a language with a rich paradigm of question words, and we identify the basic syntactic position of question words as sentence-final. Furthermore, we outline three morphological types of ČZJ question words: simple, complex, and derived.
