This study investigates differences in language production of native, early-learner, and late-learner Turkish Sign Language (Türk İşaret Dili – TİD) signers in the domain of classifiers. For this study, we conducted a picture-signing task to elicit clauses with classifier constructions from adult Deaf signers of these three groups. The results indicate that there is no significant difference among these three groups with respect to the morphological encoding of thematic roles on verbal roots in classifier constructions. Nonetheless, a difference surfaces in the argument expression patterns among these groups. The data show that the age of exposure to a first linguistic input impacts the argument expression rates as well as which arguments are expressed or left unexpressed. Native signers drop the agent argument more frequently than early-learner and late-learner signers. Early-learner signers, in turn, drop the agent argument more frequently than late-learners. The data further indicate that perspective taking interacts with argument expression and age of acquisition. Overall, signers drop the agent more frequently under a character perspective than an observer perspective, with native and early-learner signers employing this strategy more than late-learner signers.

", ,2023,"
This study explores word order patterns produced by deaf students who use Israeli Sign Language (ISL) and Arabic.
                    Nineteen students participated in a sentence elicitation task in which they retold events portrayed in 24 short videos in three
                    language conditions: signed ISL, spoken Palestinian Arabic and written Modern Standard Arabic. A control group of 19 hearing
                    students was tested in the two Arabic conditions. Results showed that SVO word order was the most frequent in both groups, and in
                    all three languages. SOV word order, which is common in ISL but ungrammatical in Arabic, was produced only by the deaf group.
                    Finally, unique word orders, specific to the signed modality were produced only in the ISL condition. The findings suggest that
                    deaf students are sensitive to the syntactic structures of each language they use and show natural cross-linguistic interaction in
                    their language use.

					Language", ,2023,"
Anaphoric pronoun resolution in spoken language has been shown to be influenced by the first mention bias. While
					this bias has been well investigated in spoken languages, less is known about a similar bias in sign languages. In sign languages,
					pronominal pointing signs (index) are directed towards referential locations in the signing space typically associated with
					discourse referents. In German Sign Language (DGS), signers follow an ipsi-contralateral default pattern while tracking referents,
					i.e., the first referent is associated with the ipsilateral and the second referent with the contralateral area of the signing
					space. Hence, directing a pronoun to either the ipsi- or the contralateral side of the signing space refers to either the first or
					the second discourse referent. The present event-related potential study reanalyzes the data from Wienholz et al. (2018) and examines the first mention effect during pronoun resolution in ambiguous
					contexts in DGS. The original study presented participants with sentence sets containing two referents without overt localization
					in the first and a sentence-initial pronominal index sign in the second sentence directed to either the ipsilateral or
					contralateral side of the signing space. Based on the direction of the index sign, our analysis reveals an N400 for contralateral
					index signs suggesting increased processing costs triggered by a violation of the first mention effect. Thus, the current study
					provides first experimental evidence for a first mention effect in DGS and highlights the modality-independent nature of this
					effect.

While there are several analyses of negation in American Sign Language (ASL), the phenomenon of negative incorporation has been overlooked in the generative literature, except for Sandler’s (1999) phonological analysis. The phonological approach makes several useful generalizations but is not without its drawbacks. We, therefore, situate our analysis in the Distributed Morphology framework and argue that negative incorporation is best analyzed as a case of negative suppletion. We motivate our approach based on the observations that (i) negative incorporation is sentential negation, (ii) negative incorporation blocks the occurrence of the canonical negation strategy for the affected verbs, and (iii) there is no verb-to-Neg movement in ASL. When taken together, these factors indicate that negative incorporation cannot be affixation. Suppletion, however, alleviates the problematic aspects of the phonological analysis while maintaining the relevant phonological generalizations.

Syntactic processes trigger changes in the movement-parameter of Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) numeral signs. Though HKSL cardinal numerals by default do not contain movement and are produced in neutral space, under specific circumstances, the movement-parameter can be altered from [∅] to specifications for both path- and hand-internal movement. This creates four types of numerals: (1) event numerals, (2) transfer numerals, (3) conjunction numerals, and (4) list numerals. I analyze the syntactic structures of these four numerals as follows: Firstly, event numerals quantify the number of times an event denoted by V has occurred and in syntax the numeral is located in a FreqP in Spec,VP. Secondly, transfer numerals show transfer of ownership and are within the DP complement of V0. Thirdly, the conjunction numeral indicates that all items of a set are included and the numeral is located within ConjP. Finally, the list numeral is the head of a NumeP with a [list]-feature within DP.

The present study investigates the effects of late sign language exposure on narrative development in Turkish Sign
                    Language (TİD) by focusing on the introductions of main characters and the linguistic strategies used in these introductions. We
                    study these domains by comparing narrations produced by native and late signers in TİD. The results of our study reveal that late
                    sign language exposure does not hinder the acquisition of linguistic devices to introduce main characters in narrations. Thus, their
                    acquisition seems to be resilient to the effects of late language exposure. Our study further suggests that a two-year exposure to
                    sign language facilitates the acquisition of these skills in signing children even in the case of late language exposure, thus
                    providing further support for the importance of sign language exposure to develop linguistic skills for signing children.

We report an experiment addressing the comprehension of LIS interrogatives in three adult populations with different times of exposure to sign language: native signers, early signers, and late signers. We investigate whether delayed exposure to language affects comprehension of interrogatives and whether there is an advantage for subject dependencies over object dependencies, as systematically reported for spoken languages. The answer to the first question is positive: there is evidence that natives outperform non-native signers, confirming permanent effects of delayed exposure to sign language even decades after childhood. However, the performance in subject interrogatives was lower than in object interrogatives in all groups of participants. We discuss several possible reasons for this unexpected finding.

Adjectives are often identified via notional or even translational criteria in sign language research, which reflects a lack of formal criteria for identifying this part of speech in the field. This paper presents the results of a guided production task investigating the conservative hypothesis that ASL has a small, closed adjective class consisting only of terms for dimension, age, value, and color. Evidence from the syntactic distribution of these core properties compared to non-core properties will be presented to refute the initial hypothesis and show that ASL has an open adjective class. Its members are characterized by their ability to occur as prenominal modifiers without function-indicating morphosyntax. The semantic distinction between core and peripheral adjectives is nonetheless reflected in a significant preference for core adjectives to be used as modifiers rather than as sentential predicates. Postnominal property signs are analyzed as (in most cases) reduced relative clauses. I further suggest that prototypically verbal signs can be used as prenominal modifiers when they are embedded in reduced relative clauses.

This paper investigates content questions and the paradigm of question words in Czech Sign Language (český znakový jazyk – ČZJ). While this topic has been investigated for a fair number of other sign languages, a comprehensive study for ČZJ is still missing. Our aim is to fill this gap. In the absence of a representative corpus for ČZJ, we use data from the most extensive electronic dictionary database (Dictio), developed at the Masaryk University in Brno. We offer a basic description of the ČZJ interrogative strategies for content questions. In doing so, we also situate the language within the typology of sign language interrogatives: we classify ČZJ as a language with a rich paradigm of question words, and we identify the basic syntactic position of question words as sentence-final. Furthermore, we outline three morphological types of ČZJ question words: simple, complex, and derived.

Sign languages have been reported to have manual signs that function as perfective morphemes (Fischer & Gough 1999; Meir 1999; Rathmann 2005; Duffy 2007; Zucchi et al. 2010). Turkish Sign Language (TİD) has also been claimed to have such morphemes (Zeshan 2003; Kubuş & Rathmann 2009; Dikyuva 2011; Gökgöz 2011; Karabüklü 2016) as well as a nonmanual completive marker (‘bn’) (Dikyuva 2011). This study shows that the nonmanual ‘bn’ is in fact a perfective morpheme. We examine its compatibility with different event types and furthermore show that TİD has a manual sign bı̇t (‘finish’) that is indeed the completive marker but with possibly unusual restrictions on its use. Based on their distribution, the current study distinguishes bı̇t and ‘bn’ as different morphemes even though they can co-occur. TİD is argued to be typologically different from other sign languages since it has both a nonmanual marker (‘bn’) for a perfective morpheme and a manual sign (bı̇t) with different selectional properties than the manual signs reported for other sign languages.

Sign languages are frequently described as having three verb classes. One, ‘agreeing’ verbs, indicates the
                    person/number of its subject and object by modification of the beginning and ending locations of the verb. The second, ‘spatial’
                    verbs, makes a similar appearing modification of verb movement to represent the source and goal locations of the theme of a verb
                    of motion. The third class, ‘plain’ verbs, is characterized as having neither of these types of modulations. A number of
                    researchers have proposed accounts that collapse all of these types, or the person-agreeing and spatial verbs. Here we present

Observations that iconicity diminishes over time in sign languages (Frishberg

                    Language), we investigated changes in pantomimic (body-to-body) and perceptual (body-to-object) iconicity. We make three key
                    observations: (1) there is greater variability in the signs produced by the first cohort compared to the third; (2) while both

Demonstratives provide an important link between gesture, discourse and grammar due to their communicative function to coordinate the interlocutor’s focus of attention. This underlies their frequent cross-linguistic development into a wide range of function words and morphemes (Diessel 1999). The present study provides evidence for a link between gesture and grammar by tracking diachronic development of a relative clause marker in Israeli Sign Language (ISL) restrictive relative clauses, which starts as a gestural locative pointing sign, and grammaticalizes into a relative pronoun connecting relative and main clauses and agreeing with referent loci, and then into an invariant relativizer. Diachronic changes are inferred from the data collected from three generations of signers. The results reveal that the behavior of demonstratives in the data varied with the signers’ ages according to four diagnostic criteria of grammaticalization (e.g., Hopper & Traugott 2003): increased systematicity, distributional and morphological changes, and phonetic reduction.

                    language, Central Taurus Sign Language (CTSL). We find that predicates involving symmetry (i.e., reciprocal and symmetrical
                    actions) differ from those involving asymmetry (i.e., transitive) in their use of the morphological devices investigated here:
                    body segmentation, mirror-image articulators and double perspective. Symmetrical predicates also differ from non-symmetrical ones
                    (i.e., intransitive) in their use of mirror-image configuration. Furthermore, reciprocal actions are temporally sequenced within a
                    linear structure, whereas symmetrical actions are not. Thus, our data reveal that CTSL expresses each type of action with a
                    particular combination of linguistic devices to encode symmetry, asymmetry, and non-symmetry. Furthermore, differences in the use
                    of these devices across age cohorts of CTSL suggest that some have become more conventionalized over time. The same semantic
                    distinctions have been observed – though with different realization – in another emerging sign language, Nicaraguan Sign
                    Language (NSL). This converging suggests that natural human language learning capacities include an expectation to distinguish
                    symmetry, asymmetry and non-symmetry.

Compounding, as a nearly universal word-formation process that is very useful in emerging languages, might be expected to conventionalize early in a language’s history. However, a recent study focusing on novel compounding in ISL and ABSL found that this may not be the case, and moreover, that the two languages appear to differ in how compounding is conventionalizing (Tkachman & Meir 2018). In this paper, we follow up on their findings, using six new measures to further evaluate lexical and structural conventionalization in the same set of novel compounds elicited by Tkachman & Meir (2018). We found that ISL shows more lexical convergence, whereas ABSL shows more structural convergence. We propose that the differences in conventionalization we observe can be linked to the different social circumstances of these languages (Meir et al. 2010).

In the study of sign language phonology, little attention has been paid to the phonetic detail that distinguishes
                    one sign language from another. We approach this issue by studying the foreign accent of signers of a young sign language –
                    Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL) – which is in contact with another sign language in the region, Israeli Sign Language
                    (ISL). By comparing ISL signs and sentences produced by ABSL signers with those of ISL signers, we uncover language particular
                    features at a level of detail typically overlooked in sign language research. For example, within signs we find reduced occlusion
                    (lack of contact), and across phrases there is frequent long distance spreading of the nondominant hand. This novel study of an
                    emerging language in a language contact environment provides a model for comparative sign language phonology, and suggests that a
                    community’s signature accent is part of the evolution of a phonological system.

Humans can use language to refer to and describe endless varieties of situations, thoughts, ideas, and topics, actual or hypothetical. This capacity, which distinguishes human language from communication systems of other animals, is referred to here as topic-open-endedness. A key factor in explaining topic-open-endedness early in the life of a new sign language is the nature of the linguistic symbols, the words, and the human ability to extend their meanings – e.g., through metonymy and metaphor – to novel semantic domains, applying a finite lexicon to infinite situations and topics. Other early language properties such as predication and negation facilitate creativity and flexibility from the beginning. The property of recursion accounts for the creation of an infinite number of sentences from a finite set of words and rules. But it cannot account for the open-endedness of the contents of those sentences. Therefore, the importance attributed to recursion as the sole mechanism that is uniquely human is overrated.

There are two main competing views about the nature of sign language role shift within formal semantics today:
                        Quer (2005) and Schlenker (2017a,b), following now standard analyses of indexical shift in spoken languages, analyze it as
                    a so-called ‘monstrous operator’, while Davidson (2015) and Maier (2017), following more traditional and cognitive approaches, analyze it as a form of quotation.
                    Examples of role shift in which some indexicals are shifted and some unshifted pose a prima facie problem for both approaches. In
                    this paper, we propose a pragmatic principle of attraction to regulate the apparent unshifting/unquoting of indexicals in
                    quotational role shift. The analysis is embedded in a systematic empirical investigation of the predictions of the attraction
                    hypothesis for German Sign Language (DGS). Results for the first and second person pronouns (ix
1 and

This paper provides a description of the distribution of buoys across genres and of their possible functions as

                    all types of buoys, the narrative dialogic genre is the most different as compared to the other three genres. It is characterized
                    by a lower frequency of list buoys and a higher frequency of fragment buoys. When focusing on discourse-marking buoys, the
                    explanatory genre attracts the highest number of tokens, which we relate to the higher degree of preparation as compared to the

Little research has been conducted on interrogative constructions in Chinese Sign Language (CSL) based on
                    naturalistic data. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of CSL interrogative constructions. Based on findings from
                    naturalistic data, both manual and non-manual components of these constructions are described and analyzed, revealing a complex
                    system. Firstly, manual markers in content questions consist of two basic wh-signs, what and how-many, which
                    form two series of wh-compounds for more specific information retrieval. As for the manual marking of CSL polar questions, three
                    types of particles are attested, namely yes, a-not-a, and some negators.
Non-manual markers work as interrogative markers in two ways: morphologically and prosodically. The former way is
                    realized by mouthings, which can be equaled to suprasegmental markers like tones in spoken language. Prosodic non-manual marking
                    is mainly realized by brow movement while head tilt, eye gaze, etc. are excluded as optional. Considering the spread of brow
                    movement, we find that polar questions without particles are predominantly marked by brow raise spreading over the entire
                    sentence, while in interrogatives with manual markers, brow movement seems to be optional, since its frequency is lower and its
                    spreading behavior less regular. CSL is proposed to be a particle-rich sign language, and some speculations are offered on what
                    may cause this behavior.

Davidson (2013) shows
                    that in American Sign Language (ASL), conjunction and disjunction can be
                    expressed by the same general use coordinator (cf. mary drink tea coord
                        coffee ‘Mary drank tea and coffee; Mary drank tea or coffee.’). To
                    derive these two meanings, she proposes an alternative semantic analysis whereby
                    the two interpretations arise through universal or existential quantification
                    over a set of alternatives licensed by (non-)linguistic cues, such as contexts
                    and prosodic or lexical material. This paper provides supportive evidence for
                    Davidson’s analysis from two other languages, Japanese and Japanese Sign

                    in one important respect: the locality of lexical elements that induce a
                    disjunctive meaning. It is suggested that this cross-linguistic variation can be
                    attributed to language-specific properties that concern the Q-particle discussed

Concerted attention in sign language linguistics has focused on
                    finding ways to document signs. Until now, most notation systems rely on a
                    complex plethora of symbols and are under-specific, to the extent that visual
                    images are still the most widely accepted way of recording primary data. This
                    paper presents a novel phonetic notation of handshape in a step towards deriving
                    an International Phonetic Alphabet for sign languages, based on digit shape
                    (configuration) and position in terms of reference coordinates, aiming at both
                    readability and precision. It is sufficiently hybrid to allow for both accurate
                    measurements and estimates of digit positions, thereby affording a way of
                    representing handshapes suitable for lexicography, studying phonetic variation

                    terms of joint angles. Variations in configuration positions are then specified

                        other. We argue that (i) whereas lateral-high R-locus is unambiguously associated with non-specificity, non-high
                    (lateral and central) loci are underspecified in terms of specificity; (ii) the R-locus of indefinite arguments observed in

                    (e.g., they, you) which are commonly found in spoken languages. The nominal strategies are determined by the
                    contexts and the referential properties of the impersonal referents, and they differ in the use of space in representing the

This paper presents a semiotic study of the distribution of a type of size depiction in lexical signs in six sign
                    languages. Recently, a growing number of studies are focusing on the distribution of two representation techniques, i.e. the use
                    of entity handshapes and handling handshapes for the depiction of hand-held tools (e.g. Ortega
                        et al. 2014). Padden et al. (2013) find that there is cross-linguistic
                    variation in the use of this pair of representation techniques. This study looks at variation in a representation technique that
                    has not been systematically studied before, i.e. the delimitation of a stretch of space to depict the size of a referent, or
                        space-based distance for size depiction. It considers the question whether the cross-linguistic variation in
                    the use of this representation technique is governed by language-specific patterning as well (cf. Padden et al. 2013).
This study quantifies and compares the occurrence of space-based distance for size depiction in
                    the lexicons of six sign languages, three of Western European origin, and three of West African origin. It finds that sign
                    languages differ significantly from each other in their frequency of use of this depiction type. This result thus corroborates
                    that the selection and distribution of representation techniques does not solely depend on features of the depicted image, but
                    also on language-specific patterning in the distribution of representation techniques, and it adds another dimension of iconic
                    depiction in which sign languages may vary from each other (in addition to the entity/handling handshape distinction). Moreover,
                    the results appear to be areally defined, with the three European languages using this representation technique significantly more
                    often than the three African languages.

                    they may associate with only even in the absence of prosodically marked focus.

In this paper. we offer a preliminary investigation of some aspects of individual and group variation in sign rate and rhythm,
                    considering the sociolinguistic factors of Age (younger and older adults), Gender, and Sign Variety (Black and Mainstream American
                    Sign Language). Differences in sign rate and rhythmic structure among signers were found in signers’ elicited narratives. A novel
                    approach to phrasal rhythm is introduced, called “rhythm ratio”, which considers sign duration and transition duration together
                    and is similar in spirit to the “normalized pairwise variability index” (nPVI) in spoken languages. This measure appears to be
                    promising as a method for identifying rhythm class in sign languages; however, due to the small number of signers in each group
                    these results can only be suggestive.

The status of syntactic resultative constructions has been disputed in the American Sign Language (ASL) literature. These are
                    single sentences such as “Mary hammered the metal flat,” where two predicates share the same object and an event
                        (hammered) causes the affected object (the metal) to change state (flat) as
                    a result. While not all languages permit such constructions, this study shows that (several) alternate multi-sentential analyses
                    can be ruled out. WH-clefts are used to provide a test for independent clausal boundaries, providing additional support that
                    American Sign Language (ASL) permits resultative constructions. We also observe possible word order variations and note common
                    features of the result predicates in these constructions.

German Sign Language (DGS) displays variation in the simple plural, the form of which is conditioned by classes of phonological
                    features within the lexicon. As a consequence, the overt realization of the plural marker is restricted to a small set of nouns
                    specified for the appropriate phonological features, while the rest are left bare (Pfau &
                        Steinbach 2005, 2006; Steinbach
                        2012). Pfau & Steinbach (2005) report a number of ‘alternative
                    pluralization strategies’ available as repairs for this underspecification, including classifier constructions, spatial
                    localization, and number and quantifier phrases. I propose a previously undescribed mechanism for plural marking, the
                    ‘classifier-based plural morpheme’ (CLP), grammaticalized from the classifier system into a morpheme in the grammars of individual
                    DGS signers. Elicitation data show that this morpheme attaches only to nouns which are specified for phonological features that
                    restrict the realization of the canonical plural marker, adding a new option to the range of pluralization strategies

We describe an intriguing interaction of negation and tense in Georgian Sign Language (GESL), a sign language which to date has
                    received close to no attention by linguists. GESL verbs that employ an irregular negation strategy in the present tense (modal
                    verbs and the verb know) require double marking in the past tense, i.e. the irregular negative form combines with the
                    negative particle not, which is not used in the present and future tense with these verbs. The GESL data thus provide us with direct
                    evidence for an active contribution of the feature tense in the grammar of GESL – in contrast to most other sign languages
                    previously studied. We also offer a cross-linguistic perspective on the data by discussing instances of Negative Concord reported
                    for various sign languages as well as tense-negation interactions attested in spoken languages.

Metaphors in sign languages have been an important research topic in recent
                    years, and Taub’s (2001) model of
                    metaphor formation in signs has been influential in the field. In this paper, we
                    analyze metaphors in signs of cognition and emotions in Russian Sign Language
                    (RSL) and argue for a modification of Taub’s
                        (2001) theory of metaphor. We demonstrate that metaphor formation in
                    RSL uses a number of mechanisms: a concrete sign can acquire metaphorical
                    meaning without change, a part of a sequential compound can acquire a
                    metaphorical meaning, and a morpheme within a productive sign or a simultaneous
                    compound can acquire a metaphorical meaning. All these processes have parallels
                    in spoken languages, so we argue for a modality-independent model of metaphor
                    formation where metaphorical mapping is divorced from iconicity.

In this paper, we investigate structural aspects of nominal modification in
                    Italian Sign Language (LIS), a language with a relatively flexible word order.
                    In order to tackle the issue, this study combines different approaches,
                    including generalizations from typological universals on word order, their
                    formal counterparts, and a variationist approach to language facts. Data come
                    from the largest corpus of LIS currently available. Despite the absence of
                    categorical rules, our mixed approach shows that LIS data are consistent with
                    the general tenets of nominal modification. Results from the statistical
                    analysis indicate that the attested language-internal variability is constrained
                    both by linguistic and social factors. Specifically, a fine-grained structure of
                    nominal modification is able to capture the internal variability of LIS.
                    Processing effects, age, gender, and early exposure to the language also play a
                    relevant role in determining order preferences.

This study explores the L2M2 acquisition of Norwegian Sign Language by hearing adults, with a focus on the production and use of
                    depicting signs. A group of students and their instructors were asked to respond to prompt questions about directions and
                    locations in Norwegian Sign Language, and their responses were then compared. An examination of the students’ depicting signs
                    shows that they struggled more with the phonological parameters orientation and movement, rather than with handshape. In addition,
                    they used fewer depicting signs than their instructors, and instead relied more on lexical signs. Finally, students were found to
                    struggle with the coordination of depicting signs within the signing space and in relation to their own bodies. It is hoped that
                    the findings from this study can be used to inform future research as well as curricula development and pedagogy.

For many of the sign languages studied to date, different types of agreement markers have been described which express agreement in transitive constructions involving non-inflecting (plain) verbs and sometimes even inflected agreement verbs. Austrian Sign Language (ÖGS) belongs to the group of sign languages employing two different agreement markers (agrm-bc/agrm-mf), which will be described in this paper. In an online questionnaire, we focused on two questions: (i) whether both forms of agreement markers are rated as equally acceptable by Deaf ÖGS-signers and hearing native signers, and (ii) whether there is a preferred syntactic position (pre- vs. postverbal) for these markers. Data analysis confirmed that both agreement markers are accepted by ÖGS-signers and that both agreement markers are slightly preferred in preverbal position. Further, possible origins of both agreement markers are discussed.

10.1075/sll.20.1.03oom,Marloes Oomen,Iconicity in argument structure,Psych-verbs in Sign Language of the Netherlands,2017,"
A long tradition of psych-verb research in spoken languages has demonstrated that they constitute a class of their own, both semantically and syntactically. This study presents a description and analysis of psych-verbs in Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT) in order to investigate whether this verb type displays comparable peculiarities in sign languages. The study is primarily based on data from the Corpus NGT (Crasborn et al. 2008). Firstly, the data indicate that all psych-verbs in NGT select a subject Experiencer. Secondly, it is shown that there is an iconic property of psych-verbs in NGT that lays bare a conceptual link between psychological states and locative relations: body-anchoring. The location singled out by the place of articulation of a psych-verb is associated with the metaphoric location of an emotion, or a type of behavior associated with the expression of an emotion. It is furthermore argued that the body as a whole iconically represents the container of a psychological state. The body is analyzed as a possessive determiner that may receive a first person specification as a consequence of body-anchoring. The data support such an analysis, as they suggest that sentences without an overt Experiencer yield a default first person interpretation. Thus, it is claimed that iconicity affects sentence structure and as such should be incorporated into the formal grammar system. Given that body-anchoring is the source of the effects mentioned above, it may be hypothesized that psych-verbs in NGT do not constitute a class of its own, but rather belong to a larger class of iconically motivated body-anchored verbs that share the properties mentioned above.

In Sao Tome and Principe there are approximately five thousand deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. Until recently, these people had no language to use among them other than basic home signs used only to communicate with their families. With this communication gap in mind, a project was set up to help them come together in a common space in order to create a dedicated environment for a common sign language to emerge.
In less than two years, the first cohort began to sign and to develop a newly emerging sign language – the Sao Tome and Principe Sign Language (LGSTP). Signs were elicited by means of drawings and pictures and recorded from the beginning of the project. The emergent structures of signs in this new language were compared with those reported for other emergent sign languages such as the Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language and the Lengua de Señas de Nicaragua, and several similarities were found at the first stage.
In this preliminary study on the emergence of LGSTP, it was observed that, in its first stage, signs are mostly iconic and exhibit a greater involvement of the articulators and a larger signing space when compared with subsequent stages of LGSTP emergence and with other sign languages. Although holistic signs are the prevalent structure, compounding seems to be emerging. At this stage of emergence, OSV seems to be the predominant syntactic structure of LGSTP. Yet the data suggest that new signers exhibit difficulties in syntactic constructions with two arguments.

Wh-doubling is a widely attested phenomenon in sign languages. Several analyses are found in the

                    under a wh-question which finally undergoes sluicing. It will be argued that such an account correctly predicts
                    the distribution of the wh-phrases found in German Sign Language doubling constructions.

How do new words arise in a sign language? We present an empirical study of newly formed words in Sign Language of
					the Netherlands (NGT). Five signers were asked to create new forms for known concepts for which word forms exist in NGT.
					Participants used sequential strategies for word formation, also found in spoken languages. More frequently, however, they used
					simultaneous strategies, some of which are unique for the visual-manual modality. We describe and discuss each strategy and focus
					on the most prominent of these, namely the simultaneous combination of meaningful form elements (Form-Meaning Units or FMUs). The
					abundance of simultaneous combinations of FMUs in our data cannot be explained in terms of concatenative morphology. We propose an
					account for word formation phenomena in NGT that uses the phonological segment as the template for simultaneous combinations of
					FMUs. This study shows that the FMUs function as basic building blocks for words and accordingly can be considered morphemes.
					Given the large set of FMUs in NGT and their frequent occurrence in the newly formed lexical words in our data, we argue for the
					acknowledgement of more morphological complexity within the lexicon of sign languages and for a re-evaluation of the relation
					between sign language phonology, morphology, and syntax.

The present research combines three fields of inquiry in sign language linguistics: verbal agreement, person features, and syntactic complexity. These topics have previously been addressed in isolation, but little is known about their interaction. This study attempts to fill this gap by investigating subject agreement in complement clauses in Russian Sign Language. By means of corpus investigation and grammaticality judgments, I found that subject agreement in clausal complements of the control predicates try, love, want, begin, and modal can may be deficient – in particular, it can be reduced to the forms identical to first-person marking even in the case of a third-person subject controller. Deficient subject agreement in complement clauses is thus reminiscent of non-finite verbal forms in spoken languages. I further argue that the choice of first-person forms in deficient agreement reveals a default status of first person in sign languages, which is consistent with proposals regarding the modality-specific properties of first-person reference in these languages.
