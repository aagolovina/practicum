This paper investigates the relationship between social and phonetic motivations for language change in Fang (Bantoid). While previous research has proposed that innovations in Fang arose due to social need and lack phonetic motivation (Mve et al. 2019; Good, Di Carlo & Tschonghongei 2020), I propose that there is a phonetic motivation and the social situation, at best, was a pathway for the innovation to gain wider adoption in the population. I provide comparative and language-internal evidence that the Fang innovations are driven by two interconnected processes, palatalization and spirantization, triggered by high vowels. These processes have been obscured synchronically in part due to the phonemic merger of *i > ə in some parts of the paradigm, thus making the alternations look phonetically unmotivated.

Wanderwords are a very common phenomenon among the languages of the world, but they are rarely discussed in
					detail. Their paths of spreading are often considered hardly reconstructible and their origins beyond reach, and being
					non-inherited, they are often ignored by the linguists working on the history of the languages involved. The present article
					questions both these tendencies, as it aims at exploring, as far as possible, the origins and interconnections of a series of
					related words referring to “apples”, “plums”, and other fruits attested in various languages and language families of the Near
					East. The article has two goals. First, to try to reconstruct the borrowing chains and general spread of these terms, thus going
					as close as possible to their putative origin. Second, to provide a test case and an illustration of a general methodological
					framework that can be used to study the history of such wanderwords.

This article gathers a motivated inventory of Old English self-manipulative verbs, including Abstain verbs and Refrain verbs, analyses their semantics and syntax and offers diachronic perspectives on the replacement of that-clause complementation with the from + -ing construction. Such perspectives go in two directions. Firstly, the semantics of the that-clause remains intact throughout the change to the from + -ing construction. Secondly, deverbal nominalisations contribute to the semantics and syntax required by the gerund. The main conclusion is that Refrain verbs are exceptional because the competition leading to the Complement Shift does not hold between finite and non-finite clauses, but between finite clauses and deverbal nominalisations. This has two important consequences: the status of derived nominal linked predications must be acknowledged, and deverbal nominalisations must occupy the top of the syntactic ranking of clause linkage.

Based on a corpus of private correspondence written by twelve influential political and cultural figures in
					eighteenth-century Spain, this article discusses several hypotheses about the role of individual variation in language change. The
					study analyses five variables undergoing change in early modern Spanish and examines the idiolectal use of the traditional
					variants. Several conclusions are drawn from the results. The first is that idiolectal patterns vary considerably from one
					variable to another. Those variants that were clearly in the majority at the time or have undergone slower change processes are
					more consistent with in-between profiles.
On the other hand, those variants that are more clearly declining or undergoing abrupt changes are represented by
					more refractory patterns. Still, these profiles are not uniform, so a specific type of variation in one variant does not exclude
					others. The results concerning the most decisive period in the configuration of the idiolectal distributions are less conclusive,
					mainly due to the imbalances in the representativeness of the samples. However, among the variables better represented in the
					corpus, the end of adolescence – set at 18 in this study – seems to be the most significant, in line with some well-known
					hypotheses in the literature. Nevertheless, we have also detected a few cases of changes in adulthood. Finally, the data support
					the dominance of stability in syntactic variation, suggesting that speakers change little once their idiolectal distributions have
					been established. Even so, some longitudinal changes are found, albeit in a recurrent direction: the replacement of traditional
					forms by alternative, more prestigious variants.

Besides highly grammaticalized analytic verb forms that constitute the system’s main tense, aspect, and mood
					forms, Basque has a handful of less grammaticalized periphrases for secondary aspectual and modal meanings. In both older and more
					recent texts, some of these periphrases have been reanalyzed as monoclausal and readjusted in accordance with the auxiliated
					verb’s argument structure. This readjustment or actualization process involves changes in two respects: case-marking and
					indexation through auxiliary change. The reanalysis and actualization of theses periphrases seem to be driven by analogy with
					highly extended and frequent analytic verb forms. With regard to their actualization, it seems to depend on three factors: word
					order, valency of the auxiliated verb, and plural patient agreement.

10.1075/jhl.22040.nar,Edoardo Nardi,The spread of participial clauses  in Biblical Greek,2023,"
In this study, a construction marginally found in Ancient Greek is addressed, namely the participial clause, which is a clause whose main verb is a participle. This construction displays a considerable increase in frequency in Biblical Greek (mainly between the 2nd century bce and the 2nd century ce), which is the language found in Judaeo-Christian literature and which features, in various ways and to various degrees, the influence of Semitic languages. Since the participial clause is a very common construction in these tongues, wherein it even exhibits increasing productivity and frequency at the time at issue, I suggest that the frequency increase observed in Greek should be attributed to the influence of these Semitic languages, with a crucial role played by multilingualism. The issue is addressed from the perspective of language contact, which provides the theoretical and terminological frame by which the phenomenon is individuated and defined.

While the phenomenon of tonogenesis is well represented in the literature, diachronic tone change in already-tonal
					languages has received less attention. This paper considers two types of tonal morphology used to mark the “potential”
					inflectional category on verbs in Coatec Zapotec (aka Di′zhke′). Some verbs are marked with upstep. Coatec upstepped tones are
					emergent tonal contrasts that are developing out of high register allotones which assimilated to a historical high tone on a
					now-deleted preceding syllable. Other verbs display patterns of tone ablaut such that a verb with underlying low or falling tone
					surfaces with high or rising in the potential. Both upstep and tone ablaut in Coatec can be traced to an earlier floating high
					tone that could dock onto different syllables according to a set of ranked constraints. Using a combination of internal and
					comparative reconstruction, details of the earlier tonal system are revealed. This is the first published treatment of
					Proto-Zapotec tone since Swadesh (1947) and the first paper to address tone in
					Proto-Zapotecan and Proto Core Zapotec. *ʔ is revealed to have been a consonant through the Core Zapotec period, suggesting that
					the complex systems of phonation contrasts found in some Central Zapotec languages are a recent development. Cases of tonal
					contrasts developing out of phonation contrasts are known from Southeast Asia, but Zapotec phonation contrasts arose out of
					interaction between the glottal consonant and pre-existing tonal contrasts. An exploration of the morphological environments
					conducive to upstep leads to new discoveries about Zapotecan derivational voice prefixes and reveals the origins of perfective
					allomorphy.

This paper analyzes vowel shifts in Wichi (Mataguayan, South America) between the 18th and early 20th centuries,
					some of which contributed to the emergence of the Pilcomayeño and Bermejeño dialects. Based on a historical database and using the
					comparative method, we date the vowel shift over the period we have named as Middle Wichi. At the early stage of
					this period, the /e/ > /a/ lowering is analyzed as a sporadic change, spread across the dialects in part of the vocabulary. At
					a later stage, the chain shift /ɑ/ > /o/ > /u/ > /e, i/, the merger of /u/ with /e/ and /i/, and the sporadic change of
					/i/>/e/ lowering in some words took place in Bermejeño. The paper explores implications in the implementation of sound change,
					the regular changes and the lexical diffusion, in particular, in chain shifting. It also explores some connections with other

This study sets out to discuss the evolution from oblique to core case as a manifestation of overtly-marked
					nominative-accusative alignment in Sinitic languages. This is due to the emergence of a type of ‘optional’ marking on preverbal
					direct objects in a construction type that has become widespread in Sinitic (Chappell &
						Verstraete 2019). In particular, I examine spoken discourse data from Taiwanese Southern Min whose comitative
					preposition, ka7
, has grammaticalized into an optional object marker. It is argued that this marker is
					undergoing morphologization into a direct object index (doi) on the main verb in the predicate, subsequent to the
					omission of the resumptive pronoun it governs. The new index takes over this function of cross-referencing the lexical direct
					object, typically located in the immediately preceding discourse, if not in clause-initial position.
In an epilogue, I also briefly treat the evolution of local cases such as the allative and the perlative to
					optional object markers in the Southern Min languages of Shantou and Jieyang, situated in Guangdong Province, China. Both of these
					are extremely rare sources in the Sinitic family, yet common in Tibeto-Burman and Romance languages. The approach adopted is in
					harmony with recent diachronic studies which target source morphosyntax in order to explain the emergence of a variety of
					synchronic patterns, all bearing similar discourse and grammatical functions (Cristofaro &
						Zúñiga 2018).

Polarity reversal has recently been argued to be the defining characteristic of counterfactuality. Ancient Greek
					had a diverse set of constructions which bring about polarity reversal that is not the direct result of a negation marker nor do
					they all express a counterfactual meaning. It is the aim of this paper to detail the major differences between these constructions
					synchronically and especially diachronically, focusing on counterfactual mood forms, counterfactual modal verbs, avertives
					(almost+past (im)perfective), non-counterfactual rhetorical questions and non-standard wishes. As a historically varied
					constructional group, these constructions bring about polarity reversal in different ways with different implicatures (e.g.,
					counterfactual, contradictory, undesirable), but they most importantly differ in their diachronic conventionalization of polarity
					reversal. Whereas counterfactuals conventionalize their polarity reversal in various ways (e.g., changing temporal reference,
					counterfactual implicature transfer), non-counterfactual polarity reversal constructions create polarity reversal as a synchronic
					implicature through pragmatic means (e.g., a rhetorical question identifying a contradictory presupposition in the common ground
					or a non-standard wish evaluating an undesirable outcome to the speaker).

10.1075/jhl.22033.col,Vincent Collette,‘Common nighthawk’ (Chordeiles minor)  in Algonquian and Siouan languages,2023,"
Some North American indigenous languages have names for ‘common nighthawk’ (Chordeiles minor)’, ‘robin’, and ‘bird’ that are strikingly similar phonetically and have served to advocate long-distance genetic relationships among language families. While the Algonquian proto-form for ‘nighthawk’ has a rather straightforward pedigree, this is not the case for Siouan languages. Despite their phonetic resemblance, the ornithonyms for ‘nighthawk’ in half a dozen Siouan languages are unrelated; some are mimetic innovations and others are borrowed. This article analyses how and why ornithonyms are problematic in the application of the comparative method, a reality that affects the validity of long-distance claims, and offers alternative ways to deal with this issue. While ornithonyms can be inherited and undergo all the regular sound changes (or not) like other words, they are also problematic in many respects. First, they can be onomatopoetic and imitate the cry or call of the bird in question – a feature that accounts for their cross-linguistic similarity. Second, they can undergo ad hoc mimetic reshaping or become lexically contaminated based on phonetic similarity with other ornithonyms or words with which they are associated culturally. Third and last, they can be borrowed internally or externally. However, despite these comparative pitfalls (i.e., that some phonetically similar forms in a language family are not cognates), the analysis shows that our understanding of ornithological nomenclature can be enhanced by considering elements of ornithology, mythology, ethnographic knowledge, sayings, and puns pertaining to birds.

Persian has a polyfunctional case marker, ‘rā’, which diachronically varies greatly in the range
					of functions it covers. In this paper, we give an account of different case functions of ‘rā’, in New Persian, an
					era from the 8th century (C.E.) to present. To analyze the functionality of ‘rā’ in different texts, we selected
					78 books from the New and Contemporary Persian eras and studied one thousand tokens of ‘rā’ from each century.
					The data show that ‘rā’ has been a polyfunctional case marker in New Persian, marking about 13 different case
					roles. Its main role was to mark direct objects, and gradually it has become its sole function in Contemporary Persian. However,
					during the time span, some of the ‘rā’-marked roles remained constant and some of them replaced
						‘rā’ with other adpositions. We follow a historical semantic map approach as a typological grid to examine
					our data. The findings show that ‘rā’ has shifted from animate to inanimate concepts gradually. While in the 12th
					century about 750 out of 1000 (about 75%) roles marked with ‘rā’ were animate, it has decreased to about 400 out
					of 1000 (about 42%) in the 19th century and less than 30% in the 20th century. Our data show that ‘rā’ has not

While previous studies have analyzed the changing nature of polarity items (PIs) in Latin (see Gianollo 2018, 2020) and the licensing conditions of PIs in modern languages (see Homer 2021), less research has analyzed the diachronic behavior of PIs in the development of the Spanish language. The present study takes a quantitative approach to historical corpus data in showing that in older varieties of Spanish, there was an increased degree of competition between items of the alg- series (i.e., alguno ‘some’) and items of the n- series (i.e., ninguno ‘none’) in negated clauses which later decreased as the language entered its modern age. We find that the competition between these items in negated clauses is influenced by factors such as register, the syntactic role of the PI, and activation status (following Larrivée 2012, 2017). These data provide quantitative support for Martins (2000), who suggested that earlier forms of Spanish exhibited more versatile licensing conditions of PIs, and that this variation gradually decreased over time due to a greater salience of the n- series in negated clauses. In total, the present work aims to use corpus data to connect historical linguistic research to theoretical approaches regarding the contemporary usage of PIs.

This study sets out several phonological features in Caijia that are notable from a diachronic point of view. The Caijia language is an endangered language spoken in northwestern Guìzhōu, China. It was first formally documented in the early 1980s and is generally viewed as a Sinitic language. Some aspects of Caijia phonology are noteworthy from the perspective of historical phonology. There exist features which cannot be accounted for in terms of Middle Chinese (MC), such as the retention of the contrast between Old Chinese (OC) T-type and L-type onsets in words with d- or dr- in Middle Chinese. Moreover, Caijia also demonstrates features which are observed or preserved in Middle Chinese, but absent in mainstream modern Sinitic varieties, including the retention of bilabial stops in words with initials Fēi/Fū/Fèng. This study will also explore the implications certain phonological features have for the classification of Caijia in the Sinitic clade and examine the relationship between Caijia and Bai.

The present study contributes to the description of the coding of anticausatives and causative-anticausative
					alternation in Classical Armenian based on conventional typologically-oriented questionnaires and a dataset of verbs attested in
					the Armenian translation of the Bible. The synchronic evidence is then analyzed from a diachronic perspective with an outlook on
					modern varieties of Armenian and the Proto-Indo-European reconstruction.
It is argued that discriminating between the derivational and inflectional tiers allows for a better explanation
					of the morphological links between the patterns used to code causative-anticausative alternation in verbs of different semantic
					types. According to preliminary quantitative estimations, the overall valency orientation of Classical Armenian is dominated by a
					nondirected equipollent coding strategy. Altogether, when coded by transitivizing pairs, causative-anticausative alternation shows
					preference for noncausal verbs of the a-conjugation, the paradigm of which typically combines equipollent
					perfective forms with labile imperfective ones.
An improved descriptive model enables a better cross-linguistic alignment of coding patterns as illustrated by
					comparing Classical Armenian to other cognate languages. Classical Armenian provides additional evidence on the typologically
					common split in the coding of causative-anticausative pairs. Whereas the transitivizing and equipollent (and marginally
					suppletive) patterns are diachronically stable within the prehistory of Armenian, the labile strategy constitutes a major
					innovation typical for the imperfective part of the verbal paradigm.

This paper explores the operation of child language acquisition as a critical factor in some forms of language change. It proposes a sociohistorical model that incorporates the potential for young children to function as linguistic agents in certain environments, characterized by unpredictable variation in the input, lack of normative mechanisms, and the possibility for the emergence of peer networks among children. The model is then applied to explain a well-documented but poorly understood phonological change in the history of Latin American Spanish: the simplification of the system of sibilants in 16th-century Colonial Spanish. This change was nestled in ecological environments characterized by intense contact among L1 and L2 speakers of several varieties of Iberian and non-Iberian languages, as well as the rapid breakdown and reshaping of social networks. We argue that, in the absence of strong normative pressures, the advantages of certain options for early acquisition were crucial in the eventual creation and generalization of a new sociolinguistic norm. This study is methodologically innovative in that it combines not just archival evidence and sociohistorical information, but also present-day acquisitional data. The latter offers a piece often missing in sociohistorical accounts of language change.

                    Chatino may be a factor in the retention of preconsonantal *n in Zapotec varieties spoken to the south. A fuller stative prefix,
                    usually *na-, arose later from a grammaticalized form of the stative-marked copula (Munro
                        2007; Uchihara 2021). *na- is more productive than *n- and
                    provides the basis for a new proposed “Eastern Zapotec” genetic grouping. However, the isogloss for *na- crosscuts the earlier
                    isogloss for preconsonantal nasal deletion, showing that any model of Zapotecan linguistic history needs to address not only

The present discussion proposes that renewal processes in the domain of negation manifest themselves predominantly
                    in the change from bi-morphemic, synthetic negation to analytic negation neg+aux by introducing a new auxiliary verb as
                    verbal head. Some of these new verbs may subsequently be merged with the negator resulting into new bi-morphemic negation. The
                    proposed analyticization process accounts for different kinds of complex negation, including aspectual and modal negation, the
                    copula and negative focus markers. I propose a unified mechanism for the morpho-syntactic processes, which change the system of
                    negation in Chinese. Two morpho-syntactic factors contribute to this particular grammaticalization process of Chinese: (1) the
                    diachronically consistent head initial word order within the functional and the lexical (CP/vP) domains (with the
                    exception of sentence-final particles); and (2) the morpho-phonological rule that negation has to attach directly to aux,
                    i.e., to a weak verbal head. Based on particularly the second constraint, I propose that only the combination
                        neg+aux
mod leads to the emergence of new fused negators constituting the head of a Negative/Modal phrase,
                    i.e., a negative phrase (NegP) with modal features. The renewal process of the verbal heads of bi-morphemic negation is caused by
                    semantic bleaching and an increasing intransparency of the negator which triggers the grammaticalization of new (often defective)
                    lexical verbs via upward movement from the lexical to the functional domain. It accounts for the grammaticalization of the

          which was used for both clausal and phrasal coordination. By comparing Khanty texts over the 20th century, we trace the emergence of overt
          conjunctions and coordination of phrasal constituents. We show that overt conjunctions first appeared in the context of clausal
          coordination, followed by coordination of smaller phrases. Based on novel elicitation data, we demonstrate that, in contemporary Khanty, (i)
          overt conjunctions are commonplace, (ii) coordinated clausal constituents may be derived via phrasal coordination or clausal coordination
          with conjunction reduction/ellipsis, but (iii) ellipsis of syntactic heads is banned (nouns & postpositions) or dispreferred (verbs).
          Based on this diachronic picture, we conclude that the coordination of phrasal constituents only emerged in Khanty once overt conjunctions
          became available. We derive this correlation from the Maximize On-line Processing principle (Hawkins
            2004), and show that this maxim, usually invoked in the context of speech planning and production, can be successfully applied to
          modelling language change.

Contrastive secondary palatalization is a feature typically associated with Slavic. However, this contrast is
                    present only in some contemporary Slavic languages, such as Ukrainian, Eastern Bulgarian, Russian, and Upper and Lower Sorbian.
                    Thus, a question arises as to whether the secondary palatalization contrast represents a Common Slavic inheritance, and how it
                    should be reconstructed. Providing such a reconstruction is important for the field of Slavic historical phonology, as well as for
                    the general understanding of the development of consonant inventories with palatal consonants and the development of secondary
                    palatalization contrasts in the world’s languages. By considering several historical scenarios, we show that /r/ : /rj/
                    is the only secondary palatalization contrast that can be reconstructed to a pre-stage common to all of Slavic. While pursuing the
                    reconstruction, we use supporting evidence from the typology of sound change and the typology of consonantal inventories in the
                    world’s languages, as well as relative chronology.

Through comparison of regular sound correspondences in three closely related Tibeto-Burman (TB) languages, Ersu,
                    Lizu, and Duoxu (collectively “ELD”), informed by external comparison with other TB languages and recent phonetic analyses of the
                    production of voiceless nasals, we reconstruct *fricative-nasal sequences in their common ancestor, Proto-ELD.
In the development of these historic clusters, two pathways of change can be recognized. Their difference lies in
                    the divergent relative phasing of velic and oral gestures in the original fricative-nasal sequences:


(i)

fricative weakening (from a tight cluster): *FN > N̥ > h̃ > x



(ii)

fricative strengthening (from a loose cluster): *F-n > *F-t > t > k or *F‑n > s



The different reflexes observed in Ersu, Lizu, and Duoxu represent different points along these two developmental
                    pathways. These reconstructions and pathways of development have implications for our understanding of both universal (phonetic)
                    and language-specific aspects of change in fricative-nasal sequences. The first pathway makes it possible to explore the process
                    of nasal devoicing beyond voiceless nasals so as to enrich our understanding of nasal devoicing in natural languages. The
                    co-existence of two opposite pathways of change, on the other hand, provides insights into the morphological and syllabic
                    structure of words with contiguous fricative-nasal sequences in ELD languages at different points in time – insights that may be
                    valuable in examining the history of other languages and language families beyond the ELD cluster.

In this article, we present the first quantitative study of what we call multiple unconditioned reflexes (MUR) in
					Bantu, more specifically of Proto-Bantu velar stops *k and *g in the West-Coastal Bantu (WCB) branch of the Bantu language family.
					MUR, also known as “doubles reflexes” in Bantu studies, represent a situation where one and the same proto-sound has two or more
					reflexes in a given language which cannot be accounted for by phonological conditioning and/or lexical borrowing. This diachronic
					irregularity has been explained in Bantu historical linguistics, and Niger-Congo studies more broadly, by reconstructing either an
					additional series of consonants (phonemic merger) or a latent conditioning that went lost (phonemic split). We show that MUR
					should not be explained, but rather taken as an indicator of the same pervasive irregularity of sound change reported in other
					parts of the world that are highly multilingual and lack a neat overlap between distinct languages and communities. Along with
					widespread multilingualism, we assess lexical diffusion, substrate influence, and spread-over-spread events in Bantu language
					history as complementary explanations for the rise of MUR in WCB.

There sentences in extreme southern Italy",2022,"
Among the morpho-syntactic patterns by which Italo-Romance varieties code there sentences, a
					peculiar structure surfaces in extreme southern varieties, particularly in Salento and in southern Calabria: this involves an
					invariable 3rd person form of the outcome of habēre as the copula, with no agreement with the postcopular nominal, the
					so-called pivot. Even though this pattern is attested in other Romance languages too, it proves, however, to be peculiar, insofar
					as it hosts top-ranking definite NPs (especially 1st and 2nd person pronouns), which are generally disallowed within ‘to have’
						there sentences in the Romance varieties. In the present paper, we infer that this pattern depends on the
					contact with Italo-Greek, which displays similar constructions, with an invariant 3rd sg. form of ‘to have’, the lack of the
					proform and the pivot marked as accusative. However, a diachronic investigation reveals that neither the extreme southern
					Italo-Romance varieties nor Italo-Greek displayed in their Medieval stage a similar construction, since both of them exhibited the
					definiteness effect. Sociolinguistic factors can account for how the two systems influenced each other by ruling out the
					definiteness effect from the respective patterns at the end of the interference process.

This study uses word embeddings to investigate the semantic changes underlying the creation of two adversative connectives in Portuguese, porém and mas ‘but, however’. For porém, we chart its development from an original PP formed by a preposition with a causal meaning (por) and a demonstrative pronoun that referred anaphorically to a previous proposition (en(de)). For mas, we trace its change from an adverb meaning ‘more’. Adopting a distributional semantics approach, we use word embedding models trained on two corpora, the CIPM (Corpus Informatizado do Português Medieval, containing texts from the 12th–16th centuries) and COLONIA (containing texts from the 16th–20th centuries). We produce a measure of change based on the similarity scores of porém and mas with respect to words in relevant semantic categories in each corpus, representing the source and the target meanings. This paper, which constitutes the first computational study of semantic change in Portuguese, also discusses challenges and outlines steps to be taken into consideration when choosing embedding algorithms for small historical corpora.

10.1075/jhl.20023.yan,Yuko Yanagida,The origin of dative subjects and psych predicate constructions in Japanese,2022,"
There is considerable literature on dative subject or non-canonical subject marking constructions in Japanese, and
					yet they have been studied mainly from a synchronic point of view. This paper investigates the diachronic dimension of
					non-canonical case marking constructions in Japanese. Following Yanagida and Whitman
						(2009), I assume that Old Japanese (700–800 A.D.) displays split active alignment. This paper argues that dative
					subjects arose as a byproduct of a change occurring from active-inactive to accusative alignment. A factor triggering this change
					was the reanalysis of some particular object experiencer predicates as intransitives due to the loss of the vestigial causative
					suffix associated with the predicate. Synchronically, these constructions involve a voice alternation of the type identified as
					the psych causative alternation by Alexiadou and Iordăchioaia (2014): object
					experiencer verbs behave parallel to causative verbs whereas alternating subject experiencer verbs behave parallel to
					anticausative verbs.

North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA), which is a subgroup of dialects of vernacular Neo-Aramaic, exhibits considerable
					internal diversity. In this paper, I describe the diversity that exists in the form of the copula in this subgroup. The paradigms
					of the copula in the various dialects exhibit different degrees of convergence with verbal inflection. There is an areal
					progression in verbalization from the western periphery to the eastern periphery. The incipient verbalization of the copula can be
					correlated with semantic properties of the subject and the clause that would be expected typologically to be most compatible with
					verbal predicates. Close correlations, however, can be identified with the distribution of pronominal and verbal inflections of
					copulas in the languages with which the NENA dialects have been in contact in the region. It is likely, therefore, that the
					realization of the internal potential verbalization of the NENA copula was induced by language contact.
