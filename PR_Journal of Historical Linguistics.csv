This paper explores the operation of child language acquisition as a critical factor in some forms of language change. It proposes a sociohistorical model that incorporates the potential for young children to function as linguistic agents in certain environments, characterized by unpredictable variation in the input, lack of normative mechanisms, and the possibility for the emergence of peer networks among children. The model is then applied to explain a well-documented but poorly understood phonological change in the history of Latin American Spanish: the simplification of the system of sibilants in 16th-century Colonial Spanish. This change was nestled in ecological environments characterized by intense contact among L1 and L2 speakers of several varieties of Iberian and non-Iberian languages, as well as the rapid breakdown and reshaping of social networks. We argue that, in the absence of strong normative pressures, the advantages of certain options for early acquisition were crucial in the eventual creation and generalization of a new sociolinguistic norm. This study is methodologically innovative in that it combines not just archival evidence and sociohistorical information, but also present-day acquisitional data. The latter offers a piece often missing in sociohistorical accounts of language change.

The paper proposes a novel structural analysis of Hittite determinate relative clauses on the basis of a corpus
					study considering a wider and fuller array of Hittite data than ever before. In Hittite, relative wh-phrases
					attest a wide range of linear positions: first/initial, clause-second, immediately preverbal or even postverbal. We build upon the
					current assumption that wh-pronouns are clitics and thus their placement is determined by the syntax-prosody
					interface. As for the syntactic component, we argue against the in situ construal of
					wh-elements. Instead, we propose that what linearly appears to be clause-second, preverbal or postverbal position
					of the wh-pronoun is structurally associated with Spec, FinP. The prosodic component is provided by the
					standardly acknowledged prosodic inversion, but the prosodic domain for the placement of wh-clitics is not
					clausal (CP), it is rather to be identified with a smaller domain within CP, namely, FinP. We also provide the first ever
					systematic treatment of split wh-phrases which are highly problematic for existing approaches but are fully
					accounted for by our analysis.

The aim and scope of this article is to take a closer look at the functions and semantics of the three relative
                    particles da, so, and wo, and to show that they have developed differently over a period from
                    1350 to 1800, continuing up to our modern dialects and the standard language. We will focus on wo because it is
                    the only relativizer which is attested both as locative relative and as general relative clause marker, and we will propose that
                        wo has extended its functional domain from a locative relative to a general relative marker. We will
                    furthermore discuss if there has been a grammaticalization path “relative locative > general relative clause marker” in German

                    extension of wo attested in the historical/modern varieties and the standard language.

10.1075/jhl.22033.col,Vincent Collette,‘Common nighthawk’ (Chordeiles minor)  in Algonquian and Siouan languages,2023,"
Some North American indigenous languages have names for ‘common nighthawk’ (Chordeiles minor)’, ‘robin’, and ‘bird’ that are strikingly similar phonetically and have served to advocate long-distance genetic relationships among language families. While the Algonquian proto-form for ‘nighthawk’ has a rather straightforward pedigree, this is not the case for Siouan languages. Despite their phonetic resemblance, the ornithonyms for ‘nighthawk’ in half a dozen Siouan languages are unrelated; some are mimetic innovations and others are borrowed. This article analyses how and why ornithonyms are problematic in the application of the comparative method, a reality that affects the validity of long-distance claims, and offers alternative ways to deal with this issue. While ornithonyms can be inherited and undergo all the regular sound changes (or not) like other words, they are also problematic in many respects. First, they can be onomatopoetic and imitate the cry or call of the bird in question – a feature that accounts for their cross-linguistic similarity. Second, they can undergo ad hoc mimetic reshaping or become lexically contaminated based on phonetic similarity with other ornithonyms or words with which they are associated culturally. Third and last, they can be borrowed internally or externally. However, despite these comparative pitfalls (i.e., that some phonetically similar forms in a language family are not cognates), the analysis shows that our understanding of ornithological nomenclature can be enhanced by considering elements of ornithology, mythology, ethnographic knowledge, sayings, and puns pertaining to birds.

Contrastive secondary palatalization is a feature typically associated with Slavic. However, this contrast is
                    present only in some contemporary Slavic languages, such as Ukrainian, Eastern Bulgarian, Russian, and Upper and Lower Sorbian.
                    Thus, a question arises as to whether the secondary palatalization contrast represents a Common Slavic inheritance, and how it
                    should be reconstructed. Providing such a reconstruction is important for the field of Slavic historical phonology, as well as for
                    the general understanding of the development of consonant inventories with palatal consonants and the development of secondary
                    palatalization contrasts in the world’s languages. By considering several historical scenarios, we show that /r/ : /rj/
                    is the only secondary palatalization contrast that can be reconstructed to a pre-stage common to all of Slavic. While pursuing the
                    reconstruction, we use supporting evidence from the typology of sound change and the typology of consonantal inventories in the
                    world’s languages, as well as relative chronology.

The present study contributes to the description of the coding of anticausatives and causative-anticausative
					alternation in Classical Armenian based on conventional typologically-oriented questionnaires and a dataset of verbs attested in
					the Armenian translation of the Bible. The synchronic evidence is then analyzed from a diachronic perspective with an outlook on
					modern varieties of Armenian and the Proto-Indo-European reconstruction.
It is argued that discriminating between the derivational and inflectional tiers allows for a better explanation
					of the morphological links between the patterns used to code causative-anticausative alternation in verbs of different semantic
					types. According to preliminary quantitative estimations, the overall valency orientation of Classical Armenian is dominated by a
					nondirected equipollent coding strategy. Altogether, when coded by transitivizing pairs, causative-anticausative alternation shows
					preference for noncausal verbs of the a-conjugation, the paradigm of which typically combines equipollent
					perfective forms with labile imperfective ones.
An improved descriptive model enables a better cross-linguistic alignment of coding patterns as illustrated by
					comparing Classical Armenian to other cognate languages. Classical Armenian provides additional evidence on the typologically
					common split in the coding of causative-anticausative pairs. Whereas the transitivizing and equipollent (and marginally
					suppletive) patterns are diachronically stable within the prehistory of Armenian, the labile strategy constitutes a major
					innovation typical for the imperfective part of the verbal paradigm.

While semantic change is notoriously idiosyncratic, cross-linguistic evidence suggests some general trends in the
					directions and mechanisms of semantic shifts. Notable among these are trends applying to the target domain of the human body, a
					domain that has received considerable attention due to its universality. However, broad surveys of many languages risk missing
					significant details. Data from the Dictionnaire étymologique et cognitif des langues romanes (DECOLAR) on the
					etymologies of terms for 97 body parts in 14 Romance languages calls some proposed trends into question. In particular,
					counterexamples are found to a supposed unidirectional shift from visible parts to the wholes that include them. Analysis of
					individual changes reveals contextual factors that can cause a lexical trend to not apply. The findings contribute to a more
					complex model of metaphorization and metonymization, the primary processes involved in lexical semantic change.

This study uses word embeddings to investigate the semantic changes underlying the creation of two adversative connectives in Portuguese, porém and mas ‘but, however’. For porém, we chart its development from an original PP formed by a preposition with a causal meaning (por) and a demonstrative pronoun that referred anaphorically to a previous proposition (en(de)). For mas, we trace its change from an adverb meaning ‘more’. Adopting a distributional semantics approach, we use word embedding models trained on two corpora, the CIPM (Corpus Informatizado do Português Medieval, containing texts from the 12th–16th centuries) and COLONIA (containing texts from the 16th–20th centuries). We produce a measure of change based on the similarity scores of porém and mas with respect to words in relevant semantic categories in each corpus, representing the source and the target meanings. This paper, which constitutes the first computational study of semantic change in Portuguese, also discusses challenges and outlines steps to be taken into consideration when choosing embedding algorithms for small historical corpora.

10.1075/jhl.21026.mei,Barbara Meisterernst,The negative cycle in Chinese,2022,"
The present discussion proposes that renewal processes in the domain of negation manifest themselves predominantly
                    in the change from bi-morphemic, synthetic negation to analytic negation neg+aux by introducing a new auxiliary verb as
                    verbal head. Some of these new verbs may subsequently be merged with the negator resulting into new bi-morphemic negation. The
                    proposed analyticization process accounts for different kinds of complex negation, including aspectual and modal negation, the
                    copula and negative focus markers. I propose a unified mechanism for the morpho-syntactic processes, which change the system of
                    negation in Chinese. Two morpho-syntactic factors contribute to this particular grammaticalization process of Chinese: (1) the
                    diachronically consistent head initial word order within the functional and the lexical (CP/vP) domains (with the
                    exception of sentence-final particles); and (2) the morpho-phonological rule that negation has to attach directly to aux,
                    i.e., to a weak verbal head. Based on particularly the second constraint, I propose that only the combination
                        neg+aux
mod leads to the emergence of new fused negators constituting the head of a Negative/Modal phrase,
                    i.e., a negative phrase (NegP) with modal features. The renewal process of the verbal heads of bi-morphemic negation is caused by
                    semantic bleaching and an increasing intransparency of the negator which triggers the grammaticalization of new (often defective)
                    lexical verbs via upward movement from the lexical to the functional domain. It accounts for the grammaticalization of the
                    aspectual negator wèi
未, of the
                    (negative) copula of Early Archaic Chinese into focus marker and complementizer, and for the replacement of synthetic by analytic

This study sets out several phonological features in Caijia that are notable from a diachronic point of view. The Caijia language is an endangered language spoken in northwestern Guìzhōu, China. It was first formally documented in the early 1980s and is generally viewed as a Sinitic language. Some aspects of Caijia phonology are noteworthy from the perspective of historical phonology. There exist features which cannot be accounted for in terms of Middle Chinese (MC), such as the retention of the contrast between Old Chinese (OC) T-type and L-type onsets in words with d- or dr- in Middle Chinese. Moreover, Caijia also demonstrates features which are observed or preserved in Middle Chinese, but absent in mainstream modern Sinitic varieties, including the retention of bilabial stops in words with initials Fēi/Fū/Fèng. This study will also explore the implications certain phonological features have for the classification of Caijia in the Sinitic clade and examine the relationship between Caijia and Bai.

This paper updates the reconstruction of the stative aspect prefix in Proto-Zapotecan as *n- and tracks
                    innovations in stative marking. An early change is proposed to have deleted preconsonantal nasals, rendering segmentally unmarked
                    stative forms of consonant-initial verbs in varieties of Zapotec then spoken in and around the city of Monte Albán. Contact with
                    Chatino may be a factor in the retention of preconsonantal *n in Zapotec varieties spoken to the south. A fuller stative prefix,
                    usually *na-, arose later from a grammaticalized form of the stative-marked copula (Munro
                        2007; Uchihara 2021). *na- is more productive than *n- and
                    provides the basis for a new proposed “Eastern Zapotec” genetic grouping. However, the isogloss for *na- crosscuts the earlier
                    isogloss for preconsonantal nasal deletion, showing that any model of Zapotecan linguistic history needs to address not only
                    divergence but also convergence. Ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence provide a social context to the linguistic changes

There sentences in extreme southern Italy",2022,"
Among the morpho-syntactic patterns by which Italo-Romance varieties code there sentences, a
					peculiar structure surfaces in extreme southern varieties, particularly in Salento and in southern Calabria: this involves an
					invariable 3rd person form of the outcome of habēre as the copula, with no agreement with the postcopular nominal, the
					so-called pivot. Even though this pattern is attested in other Romance languages too, it proves, however, to be peculiar, insofar
					as it hosts top-ranking definite NPs (especially 1st and 2nd person pronouns), which are generally disallowed within ‘to have’
						there sentences in the Romance varieties. In the present paper, we infer that this pattern depends on the
					contact with Italo-Greek, which displays similar constructions, with an invariant 3rd sg. form of ‘to have’, the lack of the
					proform and the pivot marked as accusative. However, a diachronic investigation reveals that neither the extreme southern
					Italo-Romance varieties nor Italo-Greek displayed in their Medieval stage a similar construction, since both of them exhibited the
					definiteness effect. Sociolinguistic factors can account for how the two systems influenced each other by ruling out the
					definiteness effect from the respective patterns at the end of the interference process.

					Bantu, more specifically of Proto-Bantu velar stops *k and *g in the West-Coastal Bantu (WCB) branch of the Bantu language family.
					MUR, also known as “doubles reflexes” in Bantu studies, represent a situation where one and the same proto-sound has two or more
					reflexes in a given language which cannot be accounted for by phonological conditioning and/or lexical borrowing. This diachronic
					irregularity has been explained in Bantu historical linguistics, and Niger-Congo studies more broadly, by reconstructing either an
					additional series of consonants (phonemic merger) or a latent conditioning that went lost (phonemic split). We show that MUR
					should not be explained, but rather taken as an indicator of the same pervasive irregularity of sound change reported in other
					parts of the world that are highly multilingual and lack a neat overlap between distinct languages and communities. Along with
					widespread multilingualism, we assess lexical diffusion, substrate influence, and spread-over-spread events in Bantu language
					history as complementary explanations for the rise of MUR in WCB.

					of the copula in the various dialects exhibit different degrees of convergence with verbal inflection. There is an areal
					progression in verbalization from the western periphery to the eastern periphery. The incipient verbalization of the copula can be
					correlated with semantic properties of the subject and the clause that would be expected typologically to be most compatible with
					verbal predicates. Close correlations, however, can be identified with the distribution of pronominal and verbal inflections of
					copulas in the languages with which the NENA dialects have been in contact in the region. It is likely, therefore, that the
					realization of the internal potential verbalization of the NENA copula was induced by language contact.

Through comparison of regular sound correspondences in three closely related Tibeto-Burman (TB) languages, Ersu,
                    Lizu, and Duoxu (collectively “ELD”), informed by external comparison with other TB languages and recent phonetic analyses of the
                    production of voiceless nasals, we reconstruct *fricative-nasal sequences in their common ancestor, Proto-ELD.
In the development of these historic clusters, two pathways of change can be recognized. Their difference lies in
                    the divergent relative phasing of velic and oral gestures in the original fricative-nasal sequences:


(i)

fricative weakening (from a tight cluster): *FN > N̥ > h̃ > x



(ii)

fricative strengthening (from a loose cluster): *F-n > *F-t > t > k or *F‑n > s



The different reflexes observed in Ersu, Lizu, and Duoxu represent different points along these two developmental
                    pathways. These reconstructions and pathways of development have implications for our understanding of both universal (phonetic)
                    and language-specific aspects of change in fricative-nasal sequences. The first pathway makes it possible to explore the process
                    of nasal devoicing beyond voiceless nasals so as to enrich our understanding of nasal devoicing in natural languages. The
                    co-existence of two opposite pathways of change, on the other hand, provides insights into the morphological and syllabic
                    structure of words with contiguous fricative-nasal sequences in ELD languages at different points in time – insights that may be
                    valuable in examining the history of other languages and language families beyond the ELD cluster.

This paper examines a distinctive syntactic feature of (pre)classical Spanish: asyndetic complementation (without

					declined (i.a., Girón 2005), so far no exhaustive morphosyntactic study of the
					phenomenon has been presented, as previous works either have focused on only one predicate (Blas Arroyo & Porcar Miralles 2016, 2018) or do not contain detailed

					spanning between 1400 and 1799 (GITHE 2015), we adopt the diachronic probabilistic
					grammar framework (Szmrecsanyi 2013) by means of multifactorial statistical models, to
					identify the language-internal probabilistic constraints that regulated the que/Ø alternation, and to explore
					whether their relevance changed diachronically. The results indicate that asyndetic complementation is promoted in the domain of
					manipulation verbs (e.g., requests and commands) and, more generally, by the semantic and syntactic integration of events (Givón
					2001a). Diachronically we observe that some of the effects strengthened over time, suggesting a syntactic specialization process,

					to different aspects of the extended Animacy Hierarchy. The strongest effect is that of number (singular nouns prefer animate
					marking), followed by referentiality (pronouns are more prone to take animate forms than other nominals) and definiteness
					(definite nouns show animate marking more often than indefinite ones). The analysis also shows that animate marking became more
					widespread, and that there are dialectal differences. Moreover, more factors were relevant for the alternation in the earliest
					data (number, referentiality, definiteness, person and case) than in the most recent texts, where number is the most

					was the reanalysis of some particular object experiencer predicates as intransitives due to the loss of the vestigial causative
					suffix associated with the predicate. Synchronically, these constructions involve a voice alternation of the type identified as

					experiencer verbs behave parallel to causative verbs whereas alternating subject experiencer verbs behave parallel to

This paper investigates the historical loss of root-initial consonants, using a case study of Middle Paman

					structure, phonotactics and even phoneme inventory. So far, the literature has focused mainly on identifying phonetic causes of
					initial loss. This study focuses on the actual processes and pathways of initial loss, which is an equally important part of the
					historical puzzle. Specifically, it shows that there are multiple pathways for initial loss: it can be the result of a gradual
					phonetic process involving intermediate steps like lenition, as is assumed in part of the literature, but it can also be due to
					more abrupt processes involving borrowing and even morphosyntactic alternations. This adds to a more diversified model of how
					initial loss actually proceeds, which together with earlier work on the diversity of phonetic causes of initial loss produces a
					more comprehensive understanding of this typologically and diachronically unusual phenomenon.

					system, with predicative adjectives favoring intensification over attributive adjectives, prose texts having higher
					intensification rates than verse texts, Latin-based texts having higher intensification rates than vernacular texts, and the rate
					of intensification increasing over time. The quantitative analysis of the Old English system also increases the time depth

This study presents data from modern Arabic innovations now < this time to investigate the cross-linguistic developmental pathway temporal deictic < [demonstrative [time noun]]. Products of this path (e.g., German heute, Spanish ahora) feature consistently in contrastive approaches to grammaticalization and lexicalization and have been advanced as exclusive examples of both phenomena, without clear resolution. In this investigation, I establish the derivation of now forms in dialectal Arabic from ten distinct [demonstrative [time noun]] source constructions and identify patterns of fusion and coalescence relevant to both grammaticalization and lexicalization analyses. I then demonstrate a correlated progression of indexicalization and desemanticization in these items’ semanto-pragmatic structure that firmly positions them as examples of grammaticalizing, rather than lexicalizing, change, and proceed to develop this account via examination of the cross-dialectal diffusion of now < this time as an abstract, schematized structure.

This paper investigates the long-term diachronic development of the perfect and preterite tenses in German and provides a novel analysis by supplementing Reichenbach’s (1947) classical theory of tense by the notion of underspecification. Based on a newly compiled parallel corpus spanning the entire documented history of German, we show that the development in question is cyclic: It starts out with only one tense form (preterite) compatible with both current relevance and narrative past readings in (early) Old High German and, via three intermediate stages, arrives at only one tense form again (perfect) compatible with the same readings in modern Upper German dialects. We propose that in order to capture all attested stages we must allow tenses to be unspecified for R (reference time), with R merely being inferred pragmatically. We then propose that the transitions between the different stages can be explained by the interplay between semantics and pragmatics.

The sound change from Latin /f/ to Old Spanish and Gascon /h/ has often been attributed to stratal influence from
					Basque. The motivation would be that Old Basque lacked /f/, and instead had a phoneme /h/, with which bilingual speakers replaced
					it when speaking in Romance. However, this hypothesis presents several difficulties. Most importantly, Navarrese Romance preserves
					Latin /f/, and in Basque itself, /f/ is adapted as /b/ in loanwords from Latin and Romance, not as /h/. Here we will argue that
					Old Basque had neither /f/ nor /h/. Instead, modern Basque /h/ derives from older */χ/. Medieval data will play an important role
					in establishing this. This hypothesis explains a number of morphophonological alternations, as well as some puzzling aspects in
					the treatment of aspiration in Romance borrowings, and it also makes it more difficult to hold to the stratal hypothesis for the
					Romance change /f/ > /h/.

This paper examines the history of aspiration in Eastern Balochi and aims to posit the course of its development
					and the extent to which it can be said to be contrastive. It uses primary data obtained by the author directly from various
					locales and compares sets of these data with the secondary data available on Balochi from 19th and early 20th century material. I
					maintain that, historically, voiceless aspiration arose word-initially in Eastern Balochi, in the sounds /p t č k/, and spread
					from there to other positions. In the discussion of aspiration, literature on Balochi has seen the question of influence from the
					neighbouring Indo-Aryan languages as an important problem. In this paper it is argued that equally relevant to the issue are two
					other important historical phenomena: post-vocalic lenition of stops and affricates, and gemination, a widely found but less well
					explored feature of Balochi. Also observed in Eastern Balochi, but less frequently remarked upon, is the breathiness found in
					voiced stops and affricate, a feature hitherto understood to be restricted to a small lexicon borrowed from Indo-Aryan. Focusing
					on a large number of Eastern Balochi varieties rather than seeing it as a unified whole, I attempt to show that contrastive status
					of aspiration appears to be gradually developing in these varieties. Many processes are leading in this direction, such as
					degemination and fortition of fricatives; among these one important diagnostic for the ultimate status of aspiration, I propose,
					is the transposition of glottal fricative.

This empirical study focuses on the diachrony of adnominal genitives of proper names in (Early) New High German (17th to 19th centuries), e.g., Carls Haus vs. das Haus Carls ‘Carl’s house’. Starting from the observation that word order variation exists within the whole period investigated, the study identifies determining factors for this variation and weights them in a multifactorial model of word order variation and change, the first time this has been done for German. The focus is on formal factors such as syntactic complexity, a factor that increases in importance over the observed time span. The historical data allow not only the investigation of established formal parameters but also the identification of new factors such as the type of inflectional marker (due to genitive allomorphy in older stages of German). In addition to these formal factors, genitive semantics, pragmatic information status and genre are also taken into account. Explanations for the trend towards the postnominal position of complex adnominal genitives as well as the stability of bare name possessors in the prenominal position are discussed.

This paper develops the proposal put forth by Aldridge (2015, 2016) for the emergence of ergative alignment in a first-order subgroup of the Austronesian family. I first provide new evidence for reconstructing Proto-Austronesian (PAn) as accusative rather than ergative. I then propose a significantly revised approach to Aldridge’s proposed reanalysis. On the basis of evidence from Tsou, I propose that the reanalysis took place in biclausal constructions embedded under motion or locative verbs. Since such biclausal constructions are contexts for restructuring, no accusative case is available for an object. This forced objects which needed structural licensing to value nominative case with T. I additionally show that subjects were assigned inherent non-nominative case in PAn when objects needed to enter into Agree with T, as when valuing nominative case. These conditions yielded a new ergative clause type in a daughter of PAn, which Aldridge (2015, 2016) calls “Proto-Ergative Austronesian”. No change took place in clauses lacking an object needing structural licensing. Consequently, subjects in intransitive clauses and transitive clauses with indefinite objects continued to surface with nominative case, yielding the type of ergative alignment prevalent in Formosan and Philippine languages today.

Alignment patterns in the Eastern varieties of modern Aramaic varieties are generally said to originate in an
					ergative source construction based on the so-called ‘passive’ participle qṭīl- ‘killed’ and the preposition
						l- where ergative person markers gradually extended to all intransitive predicates. While various source
					constructions have been suggested, this article demonstrates that most explanatory power and scope for the complex historical
					background of the alignment microvariation in Neo-Aramaic is offered by the typology of resultatives. There was instability from
					the beginning due to the versatile nature of resultatives and the increasing polyfunctionality of the preposition
						l-. This, in turn, indicates that the suggested source constructions for ergative alignment need not be
					mutually exclusive. Moreover, this also points to ergativity as merely one among several outcomes rather than the original
					source.

In this paper, we propose treating alignment shift as a process of functional markedness reversal in the domain of
					semantically transitive constructions. We illustrate how this approach allows us to capture similarities between the alignment
					shifts in Eskimo-Aleut and Western Austronesian languages, despite morphosyntactic differences in their voice systems. Using three
					diagnostics of functional markedness (semantic transitivity, topic continuity of P, and discourse frequency), we compare
					antipassive and ergative constructions in Eskimo-Aleut varieties and actor voice (av) and undergoer voice (uv)
					constructions in Western Austronesian varieties. We argue that ergative alignment is equivalent to a functionally unmarked
					P-prominent construction (e.g., ergative, uv), whilst accusative alignment is equivalent to a functionally unmarked
					A-prominent construction (e.g., antipassive, av). On this basis, we claim that both language groups are undergoing a
					parallel shift from ergative to accusative, since A-prominent constructions are functionally marked in more conservative
					varieties, but lose their functionally marked character and begin to function as unmarked transitive constructions in more
					innovative varieties.

This paper presents 96 sound correspondences, mainly between the two Western Kho-Bwa varieties Duhumbi and Khoitam, with

A unique innovation of the Western Kho-Bwa languages, and indeed the Kho-Bwa languages in general, is the correspondence
          of initial *s- in other Tibeto-Burman languages to a vocal onset in Proto-Western Kho-Bwa and its descendent varieties. Another relatively

                    word corpus of texts written between 1810 and 2009, we track the frequency of LVCs and analyze the range of light verb + nominal

The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative substantiation for the role of bridging context in grammatical

          therefore be predicted to occur in bridging contexts at significant rates just before the change. To test this prediction, the well-known
          evolution of Negative Polarity Items into an n-word is analysed, using the well-documented case of the aucun in the history
          of French. Charting its course in a monogeneric corpus of narrative legal material, we find that the item occurs in strong negative polarity
          environments at rates of over 50% before it is found in a majority of n-word uses. This supports the view that bridging contexts are
          instrumental to change, and that they involve quantitative conditions.

This contribution reviews a series of studies by Kelly (and Bock), suggesting that stress preferences of English nouns and verbs for left-hand and right-hand stress patterns are partly a result of alternating rhythm in real utterances. This claim is tested on diachronic corpus data to verify its historical implications. By using verse evidence to calibrate stress values for historical word classes, the quantitative analysis confirms that distributional asymmetries regarding strong and weak syllables in the contexts of nouns and verbs have existed at least since Late Middle English. In addition, the claim that stem-final segments predict the likelihood of right-hand stress is not only confirmed but the effect is found to be independent of etymological origin.

This paper presents an overview of the tens-aspect system in the Sogeram languages of Papua New Guinea. Taking the Proto-Sogeram reconstruction in Daniels (2015, 2020) as a starting point, I outline the innovations that have taken place in daughter languages and discuss the patterns of change that emerge. The study confirms a variety of known cross-linguistic tendencies, such as the common occurrence of the analytic-to-synthetic and aspect-to-tense pathways of change. More notable trends include the diachronic stability of the present and most remote past tenses; the instability of the middle pasts and future; the stability of the relative semantic ordering of tenses; the absence of a pathway leading from relative-tense to absolute-tense marking; and the ability of innovative tenses to be inserted anywhere into the five-way tense system of Proto-Sogeram. The study also illustrates how featural systems can interact over time, at first by introducing a new feature value in one system which can combine with values from another (as with the Manat habitual), and then, if the featural distinction is lost, creating a pattern of distributed exponence (as in Mum).

Languages of the Arandic subgroup of Pama-Nyungan languages of Australia have developed markers of aspect from a variety of sources, including verb phrases with stance auxiliaries and reduplicated forms. Other origins involve nominalised verb forms and the refunctionalisation of tense suffixes. Some unusual diachronic developments have to do with interactions between aspectual markers and those of the highly developed verbal category of associated motion. There are shifts in both directions – from aspectual to associated motion values as well as extension of associated motion to aspectual meanings. All the posited diachronic changes are inferred by means of reconstruction, since there is virtually no corpus of documents from which changes in real time can be traced.

The North-Angolan Bantu language Kisikongo has a present tense (Ø-R-ang-a; R = root) that is morphologically more marked than the future tense (Ø-R-a). We reconstruct how this typologically uncommon tense-marking feature came about by drawing on both historical and comparative evidence. Our diachronic corpus covers four centuries that can be subdivided in three periods, viz. (1) mid-17th, (2) late-19th/early-20th, and (3) late-20th/​early-21st centuries. The comparative data stem from several present-day languages of the “Kikongo Language Cluster.” We show that mid-17th century Kisikongo had three distinct constructions: Ø-R-a (with present progressive, habitual and generic meaning), Ø-R-ang-a (with present habitual meaning), and ku-R-a (with future meaning). By the end of the 19th century the last construction is no longer attested, and both present and future time reference are expressed by a segmentally identical construction, namely Ø-R-a. We argue that two seemingly independent but possibly interacting diachronic evolutions conspired towards such present-future isomorphism: (1) the semantic extension of an original present-tense construction from present to future leading to polysemy, and (2) the loss of the future prefix ku-, as part of a broader phenomenon of prefix reduction, inducing homonymy. To resolve the ambiguity, the Ø-R-ang-a construction evolved into the main present-tense construction.

Modern Japanese has a formally very simple tense-aspect system, which at its core has only three forms that are complemented by a number of peripheral markers and constructions. The core of the tense-aspect system was much more elaborate and complex in Classical Japanese. This paper discusses the systems of Modern and Classical Japanese, and then sketches the development from the latter to the former. This development involves the grammaticalization from aspect to tense, the recruitment of lexical means and constructions to renew aspectual categories, and category climbing. Two major paths of grammaticalization can be distinguished.

This paper examines the development of the aspect systems in the Indo-European languages Vedic and Latin. Even though aspectual distinctions are central in the verbal systems of both of these languages at the beginning of their attested traditions, they undergo quite different developments in the course of their history. The Vedic verbal system instantiates a classic case of the development from aspect to tense, whereas Latin maintains an aspect-based verbal system, which survives in the Romance languages. The paper explores the semantic properties of the Vedic and Latin past tenses in some detail from two distinct perspectives: a neo-Reichenbachian model, where aspect is regarded as a type of relation between reference time and event time (cf. e.g., Dahl 2010, 2015), and a model where aspect involves different types of partitive operators (cf. Altshuler 2013, 2014). Although these two approaches may first appear to be in conflict, the paper attempts to show that they represent complementary perspectives highlighting different dimensions of aspectual meaning.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed overview of the changes undergone by the reflexive
                        buru-construction in Basque under the light of grammaticalization theory. On the basis of quantitative
                    historical data, the reflexive construction is argued to have undergone changes predicted by the grammaticalization path of
                    reflexive markers: the distinction between regular and reflexive possessive pronouns is lost; anaphoric, non-reflexive uses of
                        buru disappear; and number agreement between the subject and buru is no longer obligatory.
                    The buru-construction is furthermore argued to have become more prevalent at the expense of other reflexivization
                    strategies. As opposed to these changes, the reflexive construction seems to have degrammaticalized as well: the number of direct
                    object uses of this construction decreases over time, and it occurs in subject position with more predicates in present-day
                    written Basque than in the historical period. In view of these facts, an argument is made against unidirectional conceptions of
                    grammaticalization. External motivations for these developments, such as the standardization of the language, are also
                    considered.

                    syllable-internal transitions between nucleus and coda in order to explain the fine details of HCL; namely, the fact that HCL
                    applies with higher frequency to high vowels followed nasals than to low/mid vowels and in a sporadic manner to front vowels
                    followed by /l/ compared to back vowels. These differences are attributed to the application of the Coda and Nucleus Laws (Vennemann 1988: 25, 42), with additional proposals about the effect of velarization of
                    /l/ in Old English, with comparison to PCS providing important context throughout.

The grammaticalization framework has been suggested as a predictive power for language change. This paper considers the grammatical functions of the locative construction fi(ih) in the Gulf Arabic Pidgin (a variety spoken by workers from the Indian subcontinent and south Asian countries working in the Arabian/Persian Gulf States). In Gulf Arabic, there are (1) the preposition fi ‘in; into; inside’ and (2) the locative construction fi(ih) ‘there is/are’, which only has an existential function. In Gulf Arabic Pidgin, the locative construction fi(ih), however, has several grammatical functions, including (1) a possessive marker (i.e., have-constructions), (2) an equative/predicative copula, and (3) a preverbal predicative marker. The aim in this paper is two-fold: first, to show how a grammaticalization framework can possibly account for the grammatical innovations of fi(ih) in the Gulf Arabic Pidgin; and second, to suggest that these grammatical innovations might be the results of an ongoing grammaticalization process of LOCATIVE>TMA/PROGRESSIVE. Earlier studies conducted on this pidgin serve as data sources for this project.

                    grammatical information once within an inflected word, and against multiple exponence. Yet the phenomenon of multiple exponence is
                    attested in a number of languages. This paper presents comparative evidence from the Kiranti languages that supports the claim
                    that multiple exponence in synthetic verbs in the modern Kiranti languages comes as a result of the interaction between
                    language(family)-specific typology (multiple agreement in periphrastic verbs) and an uncontroversial language change process
                    (coalescence of periphrastic forms into synthetic forms).

It has recently been argued that Arawakan languages of South America provide evidence for a novel historical
                    source for standard negation, a privative derivational affix. This hypothesis posits that the prefixal standard negation found in
                    some languages of the family developed from a privative prefix, ma-, present in Proto-Arawakan, that originally
                    derived privative stative verbs from nouns. According to this account, the function of this prefix extended, in many languages of
                    the family, to negating nominalized verbs in subordinate clauses, and then, via insubordination, to standard main clause negation,
                    in a smaller subset of languages. The purpose of this paper is to substantiate this hypothetical trajectory in detail in a
                    particular Arawakan language: Lokono, a highly endangered language of the Guianas. On the basis of modern linguistic fieldwork and
                    colonial-era language materials, we show that 18th-century Lokono exhibited a standard negation construction based on the
                    privative, and that this construction exhibits clear signs of its subordinate clause origin. We show that Lokono also exhibits the
                    full range of functions for the privative ma- that are predicted to be historical precursors to the standard
                    negation function, substantiating the historical trajectory from privative derivation to standard negation. We conclude by
                    observing that the prefixal standard negation strategy has lost ground since the 18th century to a standard negation particle that
                    originally expressed constituent negation, possibly due to contact with colonial languages that employ similar strategies.

This article presents the results of a diachronic survey on the multilingual account books authored by the wardens
                    of the Mercers’ premier livery company of the City of London from 1390 to 1464. The study deployed here applies an extended
                    version of Wright’s three-stage model of code switched business writing that introduces a previous phase of Romance monolingualism
                    and a later phase of English monolingualism. It is found that the change from Latin and French to English as the new language of
                    business record in the London Mercers’ archives was orderly and gradual rather than straightforward, and characterised by a less
                    predictable intervening code switching period. The analysis is of considerable value for expanding our knowledge of medieval
                    written multilingualism, as well as for the development of English as an administrative language.

The languages of central Flores are all but devoid of affixation, despite that this is hardly typical of the
                    Austronesian languages of their family, including closely related languages elsewhere on the island and nearby ones. A traditional
                    approach to these central Flores languages’ typology is to ascribe their analyticity to grammar-internal drift, under which the
                    disappearance of this affixal battery was due merely to fortuitous matters of stress, analogy, reanalysis, etc. Here I argue that
                    a great deal of evidence suggests that these languages actually underwent heavy second-language acquisition by adults at some
                    point in the relatively recent past, most likely by male invaders from a different island. The evidence includes phenomena
                    familiar from recent developments in creolization theory, as well as a cross-linguistic approach to analyticity and its
                    causes.

This study reconstructs the development of a negative existential and a negative pro-sentence in the Arawan
                    language Kulina (Brazil-Peru). We demonstrate that the two elements forming the negative existential construction nowe
                        (hi)ra- are involved in a double polarity swap: (i) an originally neutral lexical item (the dynamic verb
                        nowe ‘show’) has become negative through contamination, and (ii) an originally negative element
                        (hi)ra-, which was responsible for the contamination, is bleaching into a semantically neutral auxiliary.
                    This lexeme nowe, with the auxiliary used only optionally, also functions as a negative pro-sentence now. Thus,
                    synchronically we have a negative pro-sentence that has its origin in a semantically-neutral lexical item. Neither the source of
                    the negative pro-sentence nor this diachronic path has surfaced in the literature on negation so far and thus they are instructive
                    from diachronic and typological perspectives. The hypothesis enriches the literature on both the Jespersen Cycle and the Negative
                    Existential Cycle.

The aim of this paper is to look at some of the problems with the traditional subdivisions of Iranian and at

                    discussion and further illustrating problems in the data and methods involved in the traditional model of relations among the
                    Iranian languages. It specifically points out that the traditional family tree is based on a set of isoglosses that is an artefact
                    of the data that happened to be available at the time. In addition, the question arises whether the wave model or the concept of
                    linguistic areas would be more adequate to account for the data. The discovery of a corpus of Bactrian manuscripts encourages a
                    new approach. I argue that a sub-branch including Bactrian, Parthian and some other languages is a hypothesis that deserves to be
                    tested; at the same time, the comparison with other Iranian languages as well as typological considerations permit to assess the

Recent applications of phylogenetic methods to historical linguistics have been criticized for assuming a tree
                    structure in which ancestral languages differentiate and split up into daughter languages, while language evolution is inherently
                    non-tree-like (François 2014; Blench
                    2015: 32–33). This article attempts to contribute to this debate by discussing the use of the multiple topologies method
                        (Pagel & Meade 2006a) implemented in BayesPhylogenies (Pagel & Meade 2004). This method is applied to lexical datasets from four different
                    language families: Austronesian (Gray, Drummond & Greenhill 2009), Sinitic (Ben Hamed & Wang 2006), Indo-European (Bouckaert
                        et al. 2012), and Japonic (Lee & Hasegawa 2011). Evidence for multiple
                    topologies is found in all families except, surprisingly, Austronesian. It is suggested that reticulation may arise from a number
                    of processes, including dialect chain break-up, borrowing (both shortly after language splits and later on), incomplete lineage
                    sorting, and characteristics of lexical datasets. It is shown that the multiple topologies method is a useful tool to study the

This paper deals with the historical relations between dialects of Boni, a Cushitic language of Kenya and Somalia.
                    Boni forms the subject of Volume 10 of the Language and Dialect Atlas of Kenya (Heine & Möhlig 1982). Heine presents evidence for three subgroups within Boni, as well as several
                    areas of convergence between dialects belonging to different proposed subgroups. In reviewing his evidence, I find that two of the
                    three splits are not supported by the data, and therefore his conclusions on convergence must also be reinterpreted. Given the
                    presence of numerous intersecting isoglosses, the tree diagram is an inappropriate model for describing the relations between Boni
                    dialects, and I turn to Historical Glottometry (Kalyan & François 2018) to provide
                    a visualization of the data.

                    representing the relationships among sister languages in a language family. We present a glottometric analysis of the Sogeram

                    regard as problematic: how to handle the higher incidence of cross-cutting isoglosses in the Sogeram data; how best to handle
                    lexical innovations; and what to do when the data do not allow the analyst to be sure whether a given language underwent a given

Skepticism regarding the tree model has a long tradition in historical linguistics. Although scholars have
                    emphasized that the tree model and its long-standing counterpart, the wave theory, are not necessarily incompatible, the opinion
                    that family trees are unrealistic and should be completely abandoned in the field of historical linguistics has always enjoyed a
                    certain popularity. This skepticism has further increased with the advent of recently proposed techniques for data visualization
                    which seem to confirm that we can study language history without trees. In this article, we show that the concrete arguments that
                    have been brought up in favor of achronistic wave models do not hold. By comparing the phenomenon of incomplete lineage sorting
                    in biology with processes in linguistics, we show that data which do not seem as though they can be explained using trees can
                    indeed be explained without turning to diffusion as an explanation. At the same time, methodological limits in historical
                    reconstruction might easily lead to an overestimation of regularity, which may in turn appear as conflicting patterns when the
                    researcher is trying to reconstruct a coherent phylogeny. We illustrate how, in several instances, trees can benefit language
                    comparison, although we also discuss their shortcomings in modeling mixed languages. While acknowledging that not all aspects of
                    language history are tree-like, and that integrated models which capture both vertical and lateral language relations may depict
                    language history more realistically than trees do, we conclude that all models claiming that vertical language relations can be
                    completely ignored are essentially wrong: either they still tacitly draw upon family trees or they only provide a static display
                    of data and thus fail to model temporal aspects of language history.

This study is a corpus-based investigation of the development of English clause-initial quotative inversion, i.e.
the construction in which a reporting clause with SV inversion is placed before the quoted message. The analysis makes use of
various corpora of historical and contemporary English in order to document quantity and quality changes in the investigated
construction in all stages of English. The study shows that the construction observed in Present Day English has developed in a
continuous way since the period of Old English, although it has been a low-frequency pattern in each historical period. Moreover,
the construction has developed differently in British and American English. In the former variety, the clause-initial quotative
inversion is still quite rare and limited to newspapers, mostly tabloids; in the latter, it is quite widespread in magazines,
where it shows an exceptionally high frequency and a growing collocational range.

This article offers an analysis and systematization of the relationship between directionality and
grammaticalization and develops an innovative proposal regarding a new type of directionality. The article proposes four types of
directionality in grammaticalization: A. down, B. up, C. neither down nor up,
and D. up and down. The first three types are very well studied, but the last has been overlooked in the
theoretical literature. The article analyzes directionality D in depth. It is a directionality that is very similar to a round
trip: an up in the cline is followed by a down in the cline. First, the form or construction leaves sentence grammar and enters
into periphery grammar, acquiring a new category and a discourse meaning, generally a subjective one; later, the form comes back
into sentence grammar, but always re-enters as a different category from the etymological source. This process appears to be
round trip directionality. This round trip process constitutes a fourth type of directionality in
grammaticalization. Directionality D requires its own status, distinct from the sum of directionalities A and B, due to its
specific source and due to the fact that the reinsertion into the sentence grammar is in a specific category. It has its own
individual distribution and a characteristic and innovative circular path. The evidence of this directionality presented in this
article comes from Spanish, but this path very likely also generalizes to other languages.

It has repeatedly been observed that there is a worldwide preference for suffixes over prefixes. In this article,
                    we argue that universally dispreferred – or rare – structures can and do arise as the result of regular processes of language
                    change, given the right background structures. Specifically, we show that Ancient Egyptian-Coptic undergoes a long-term diachronic
                    macro-change from exhibiting mixed suffixing-prefixing to showing an overwhelming preference for prefixing. The empirical basis
                    for this study is a comparison of ten typologically significant parameters in which prefixing or affixing is potentially at stake,
                    based on Dryer’s (2013a) 969-language sample. With its extremely high prefixing
                    preference, Coptic belongs to the rare 6% or so of languages that are predominantly prefixing. We argue that each of the
                    micro-changes implicated in this macro-change are better understood in terms of changes at the level of individual constructions,
                    rather than in terms of a broad structural “drift.” Crucially, there is nothing unusual about the actual processes of change
                    themselves.

Modern Hebrew provides an idiosyncratic case for historical linguistic study: due to the discontinuity of its use as a spoken
                    language, differences between contemporary structures and classical ones do not necessarily reflect change processes, but may
                    instead result from imperfect language learning by the original L2 speakers of Modern Hebrew at the initial stages of speech
                    revival. This article offers a new research direction for delineating the boundaries between the two types of phenomena based on
                    the recent discovery of two collections of recordings of spontaneous Hebrew speech made in the 1960s. Focusing on one conspicuous
                    sound change in contemporary Modern Hebrew, namely the transition from [i] to [e] in the prefix of the verbal pattern
                        hif’il, we show that the variability in contemporary language between hif’il and
                        hef’il has two distinct sources: (i) an initial state of variability between [i] and [e] in forms derived
                    from weak root verbs (initial-[n] and middle-[w/y] roots, e.g. higi’a-hegi’a ‘arrived’) due to imperfect language
                    learning in the initial phases of the formation of Modern Hebrew; and (ii) a recent change from [i] to [e] in forms derived from
                    regular roots (e.g. hitxil-hetxil ‘started’). In this category, the 1960s recordings attest to a stable
                    realization of [i] amongst all age groups, with deviations from the rules of traditional Hebrew grammar occurring only marginally.
                    Based on this data, the measure of synchronic variation documented in the 1960s recordings is analyzed as a precursor of the sound
                    change that developed in the language at a later stage.

The presence of two forms of the future and conditional paradigms in Old Spanish is well-attested. The analytic form, which was
                    marked by a mesoclitic, was more syntactically restricted, while the synthetic form, which surfaced with either a proclitic or an
                    enclitic, was essentially free to appear in any syntactic context. It is notable that the analytic form was only acceptable in
                    contexts in which finite verbs obligatorily hosted enclitics. In this article, I test various morphosyntactic factors to determine
                    the level of variation among the analytic and synthetic future and conditional forms across six centuries of Old Spanish. The
                    factors of verb tense, preverbal constituent, and verb stem morphology significantly affect the emergence of mesoclisis or

The relationship between Unangam Tunuu (Aleut) and Eskimo was established in the early 19th century, and the 20th century
                    especially saw a number of efforts on the reconstruction of Proto-Eskimo-Aleut (PEA). Reconstruction has supported assumptions of
                    a largely genealogical relationship between the EA languages, assumptions which include a long history of independent development
                    in isolation from other languages and language families. The reconstruction of PEA, however, is incomplete; many apparent cognates
                    have irregular or imperfectly understood sound correspondences. Furthermore, advances in archaeology and genetics have called into
                    question many assumptions about EA prehistory and about the isolation or lack thereof of Unangam Tunuu. In this study, I
                    re-examine the proposed cognates and evaluate them based on the strength of their correspondences and their distribution within
                    the lexicon, with reference to new findings regarding technological innovations and periods of cultural contact. Several patterns
                    emerge, including a large group of proposed cognates with overly-specific semantic correlations relating to technologies or
                    cultural practices post-dating the split of EA languages, a gender-based difference in the number of cognates relating to cultural
                    activities, and a correlation between known borrowings and high levels of cognates in certain semantic domains. Results suggest
                    extensive language contact, especially in the past millennium.

The reported speech construction found in the Chapacuran language family of South America has undergone a number of changes in the individual languages, such that its uses extend beyond that of merely reporting speech. In many languages, it is used to express the inner states of the reported speaker, and in some cases it is used to express imperfectivity and causation. This paper argues that the future construction in Moré is a further development of the reported speech construction, one that has been reanalyzed as a basic main clause type. The morphosyntactic properties of the source construction explains the divergent inflectional forms, the loss of object indexation, and the innovation of an object case marker in the future construction. This paper provides new insights into the diachronic pathways that can lead to innovative future constructions as well as the origins of a tense-based split in case marking in Moré.

                    therefore have preceded the rise of the right-margin subject markers ‑sæ, -hæ and ‑Ø. Based on
                    comparative Mako data, I propose that these markers are old copular suffixes that entered the verbal domain through a nominal
                    predication construction whose use expanded to encode habitual aspect. This research not only constitutes an important
                    contribution to the description of Piaroa but also expands, within a Diachronic Construction Grammar approach, our understanding
                    of complex systems of person marking, the origins of multiple exponence, and the role of multiple source constructions in paradigm
                    creation.

This article describes the evolution of past/perfective subject-verb agreement morphology in the Tukanoan family, reconstructing relevant aspects of Proto-Tukanoan verbal morphology and delineating the subsequent diachronic development of verbal subject agreement morphology in the Eastern branch of the family. We argue that suffixes that cumulatively expone past/perfective and person, number, and gender (png) subject agreement resulted from the fusion of post-verbal demonstratives/pronouns expressing png information with suffixes expressing past/perfective tam information. We propose that different png agreement categories developed at successive stages in the diversification of the family, with third person masculine singular subject agreement emerging before other png categories, followed by animate plural agreement, then finally by the development of third person feminine agreement. The result in Eastern Tukanoan was a cross-linguistically unusual agreement system that contrasts four agreement categories: (i) first and second person singular and third person inanimate (singular and plural); (ii) third person animate masculine singular; (iii) third person animate feminine singular; and (iv) third animate plural.

This article proposes that the divergent pattern of verb argument marking found in object focus clauses in the Tuparian branch of
                    the Tupian family comes from the reanalysis of an object nominalization in a cleft construction. Based on the distribution of free
                    and bound person markers, the major alignment pattern can be characterized as nominative-absolutive in simple clauses, with free
                    pronouns expressing the nominative, whereas bound person markers express the absolutive. However, object focus clauses show a
                    distinct alignment pattern: the ergative, and not the absolutive, is indexed by the bound markers on the verb. We present
                    arguments for identifying the object nominalization as the source of this grammar in the object focus clause, showing also how
                    this reanalysis resulted in the nominalizer morpheme and the person markers gaining new functions.

Subject marking in the Western Tukanoan language Ecuadorian Siona is part of a complex system of portmanteau morphology that also marks tense and clause type. This system shows a remarkable number of regularities that hint that it might be possible to tease apart these functions. Synchronically, it is problematic to posit distinct markers for each of the three relevant linguistic categories, but diachronically, it is likely that these categories were expressed by distinct markers. This article reconstructs the pathway of the formal merger of these three linguistic categories, comparing the expression of Ecuadorian Siona’s system to the expression of these categories in other Tukanoan languages.

Using quantitative corpus evidence from different periods, the present article analyzes the emergence and diachronic development of
                    the Spanish time constructions (clausal and adverbial) involving contemporary hacer ‘make’ and earlier
                        haber ‘have’. The obtained data, as well as cross-linguistic evidence, suggest that the clausal construction
                    must have been the source of the adverbial one. A proposal is presented that could explain that development. The data show, in
                    addition, that the grammatical properties and usage patterns of the clausal and adverbial constructions were very similar until
                    the 16th century but have been diverging ever since. This divergence coincides with an exponential increase in the textual raw
                    frequency of the adverbial construction, where word order fixation, erosion of the inflectional morphology and a change in the
                    possibilities for time adjunction among others are found to occur at around the same time. This points towards a

Since the 19th century linguists have expected to find conditioned sound changes in environments that make phonetic sense: consonants palatalize adjacent to front vowels, back vowels front if a front vowel occurs in the next syllable, stops voice between voiced segments, and so forth. Most conditioned sound changes conform to this expectation, but a surprising number do not. Some of these are well known, as the palatalization of *s before most word-initial consonants in High German. Since there is no obvious explanation for them, such changes are generally ignored in discussions of historical phonology. The result of this practice has been to give the false impression that what appear to be phonetically unmotivated sound changes are rare abnormalities that probably would conform to expectation if we had more information about them. This paper draws attention to examples of conditioning in Austronesian languages in which the phonetic properties of the context appear unrelated to those of the change, and it questions why such changes should occur. Although finding a completely satisfactory explanation has proven difficult, one general conclusion suggested by the data is that native speakers have an intuitive recognition of natural classes that is independent of phonetic motivation.

10.1075/jhl.16022.vio,Lorella Viola,A corpus-based investigation of language change in Italian,2018,"
In Italian, grazie ‘thanks’ and ringraziare ‘to thank’ historically introduce an object by means of the preposition di ‘of’ (Renzi, Salvi & Cardinaletti 1991: 545–548); when grazie and ringraziare introduce a subordinate infinite clause, they may all the same be followed by either di or per ‘for’, the latter being the habitual preposition introducing an implicit causal subordinate (ibid.). In light of these considerations, a general lower frequency of occurrence of collocations with per would be expected. This article argues that, in contemporary Italian, there has been an increase in the use of constructions with per and that such an increase is due to an influence from the English thanks/to thank for. Through diachronic lexicographic, quantitative and qualitative analyses carried out over a range of dictionaries and corpora, this article will show that the frequency of use of forms with per has indeed more than octupled in writing from 1200 to 2011 and more than doubled in speech from 1965 to 2003. Moreover, by analyzing the distribution of the studied constructions in a corpus of dubbed Italian from (American) English, the article will also explore the possibility that language contact with English, mainly via dubbing translations, may have played a concurrent fundamental role motivating such changes.

Borrowing affixes may be rare compared to lexical borrowing, but it is not random. The current study describes regular patterns of affix borrowing in a database containing 649 borrowed affixes, challenging a number of previous claims about relative borrowability, in particular regarding inflectional categories. It is shown that borrowing affixes of all major nominal and verbal inflectional categories, including case markers and argument indexes, is well attested. Borrowing case markers, for instance, appears to be just as common as borrowing plural markers. By factoring in the “availability” for borrowing (i.e. whether a potential donor language has a relevant affix), it can be shown that nominal categories are far more frequently borrowed than verbal categories. Additionally, it is shown that sets of borrowed affixes often consist of interrelated sets of forms, e.g. forming paradigms, rather than being isolated forms from different morphosyntactic systems, in particular for the more tightly integrated inflectional subsystems. The frequency and systematicity by which inflectional affixes are borrowed calls for a reconsideration of the role of inflection in models of language contact.

This article addresses the semantic and morphosyntactic development of the German evidential adverbs offensichtlich, offenbar, anscheinend, and scheinbar ‘obviously’/‘apparently’/‘seemingly’ and their meaning contribution in present-day German. It will be argued that these expressions, most of which are historically derived from adjectives, innovated separate lexical entries as sentence adverbs in New High German resulting from a morphosyntactic reanalysis of an ambiguous surface structure. This reanalysis was accompanied by a profound semantic change, as a result of which the expressions acquired a wide-scope reading of the type ‘there is (clear) evidence that p’. The diachronic results are corroborated by experimental data from Present-Day German that show that these evidential sentence adverbs are underspecified with respect to evidence type (inference and report). The diachronic and synchronic findings are furthermore discussed in the light of grammaticalization and subjectification theory.

Typologically-unexpected overt expletives can be found in a restricted number of non-standard Ibero-Romance null-subject varieties. Historical data suggest that these overt expletives, which in today’s varieties show both discourse-oriented and expletive characteristics, have their origin in 15th century impersonal epistemic constructions. This article argues that it is the expletives’ epistemic origin which gives rise to, and thus explains, their present-day heterogeneous properties, in particular their function as a marker of epistemicity in a number of varieties. Despite undergoing the same mechanisms of change, the variation in modern Ibero-Romance is understood to be a consequence of the different stages and degrees of grammaticalization reached in each variety.

I demonstrate that the distributional, semantic, and pragmatic properties support a monoclausal analysis for Modern Spanish Adv+C as well as for its historical source construction. I propose a cartographic analysis associating Adv+C and the source construction with a low position in Rizzi’s split CP. Supported by corpus data, I identify a verum focus construction (Aff+C) as the origin of Adv+C. I claim that the loss of the verum interpretation triggers the reanalysis of the construction. This ultimately gives rise to its productive extension to other epistemic and evidential modifiers.

This article studies the evolution, from Medieval to Modern French, of three evidential markers that are semantically related from a diachronic perspective: il m’est avis que ‘I think that’, ‘it seems to me that’, apparemment ‘apparently’, and il paraît que ‘it seems that, apparently’. This study demonstrates the rise of the modal and evidential uses of the markers in question, from the Medieval period onwards, and provides a semantic characterization of these three epistemic-evidential markers in order to precisely grasp the evolution of their meaning. Using information from a number of databases, this article provides empirical support for the study of the different types of evidentiality, their evolution, and their interaction with the epistemic commitment of the speaker and the degree of certainty. The three markers have evolved towards greater subjectivity and a lower degree of certainty. Their historical semantic description shows that a marker may shift diachronically between various types of evidence.

The article traces the diachronic development of the assumed evidential needless to say. This parenthetical
                    expression allows the speaker to make certain assertions regarding the obviousness of what s/he is about to say, thus serving as
                    an evidential strategy that marks the information conveyed as being based on inference and/or assumed or general knowledge.
                    Parenthetical needless to say has its roots in the Early Modern English needless to-inf
                    construction (meaning ‘it is unnecessary to do something’), which originally licensed a wide range of infinitives. Over the course
                    of time, however, it became restricted to uses with utterance verbs, eventually giving rise to the grammaticalized evidential

                    become conventionalized and that the first parenthetical uses of the construction are attested. In Present-day English,

This article focuses on the diachronic development of English turn out and Spanish resultar ‘turn out’ mirative constructions. Having undergone processes of semantic generalization over time, both verbs express evidential and, most prominently, mirative nuances in the present-day languages. This study explores the mechanisms that condition the evolution of turn out and resultar from their original meanings as lexical resultative and change-of-state verbs towards their eventual subjectification and grammaticalization as predicates conveying evidential and mirative senses. The present-day mirative constructions take that- and infinitival complement clauses in both languages. The analysis suggested here shows that both verbs exhibit diverging, though closely related, paths and degrees of grammaticalization. Moreover, this study delves into the further development of these predicates as parenthetical expressions. While English parenthetical turns out has already been grammaticalized, Spanish resulta may be on its way to becoming a grammaticalized parenthetical.

This article demonstrates the diachronic development of present-day Dutch klinken as an evidential copular verb meaning ‘to seem, based on (auditory) evidence’ from the Middle Dutch intransitive verb klinken meaning ‘to give off a clear sound’. I identify four semantic stages in the history of klinken, which are divided by processes of semantic bleaching (14th–16th century, 16th–17th century) and subjectification and copularization (during the 16th century). I claim that the process of copularization is the trigger of both the evidential meaning and the subjective interpretation that copular constructions with klinken receive. Furthermore, I show that, unlike the development of eruitzien ‘look’ and voelen ‘feel’ from cognitive perception verbs, klinken has developed much like the Dutch copular verbs schijnen ‘seem’ and blijken ‘turn out’: from an intransitive verb with a sensory-related meaning.

The notion of mirativity as a grammatical category separate from evidentiality is controversial, but a certain amount of cross-linguistic evidence speaks for its validity. The aim of this study is to investigate this notion in contemporary and earlier Japanese, which is shown to have mirative constructions: (i) no miratives, (ii) koto miratives, and (iii) lexical miratives. The particles no and koto are polyfunctional, and they have recently gained a mirative function. Lexical miratives are uttered by the younger generation. These findings raise a diachronic issue regarding the emergence of the three mirative constructions. Adopting Cruschina’s (2011) cartographic approach to discourse-related phenomena and the notion of “emotional vocative” offered by Yamada (1936), we argue that what binds the three constructions together is the involvement of the IFocP (Information Focus Phrase) and that their emergences are all explained by grammaticalization paths starting from nominals.

The epistemic verbal categories “evidentiality” and “egophoricity” play an important role in the verbal systems of many Tibeto-Burman languages of the Himalayas. In the course of the past decades, our synchronic understanding of those grammatical categories has been considerably enhanced by numerous descriptive studies. However, little is still known about the diachronic processes that give rise to evidentiality and egophoricity. The article addresses this gap by discussing evidence from Bunan, a Tibeto-Burman language, for which the development of evidentiality and egophoricity in its past tense system can be reconstructed in detail. It is argued that the evolution of the two categories can be explained by reference to two processes: (i) the reanalysis of a resultative construction as an inferential past tense and (ii) the reanalysis of third person agreement markers as allophoric markers. In addition, it is maintained that the concept of Scalar Quantity Implicature is crucial to account for the evolution of the two categories.

This article is a suggested explanation for the multiple variants of the forms of some Malayo-Polynesian pronouns that have been characterized as the result of drift. The explanation that is given is referred to here as paradigmatic instability, a phenomenon not previously discussed with reference to these problems. In the cases discussed in this article it is the avoidance of forms that are semantically or pragmatically inappropriate within the context of the paradigm in which they occur which renders the forms morphologically variable and the paradigms in which they occur unstable. In Malayo-Polynesian languages, it is the avoidance of a form that is reconstructed as a plural pronoun in Proto-Austronesian but which in all Malayo-Polynesian daughter languages is found as a singular pronoun. Where this form is retained as part of some other plural forms, it has been lost or modified in a wide range of variants in the daughter languages.

Five features of the eleven are conjectured as major on the basis of frequency of occurrence and frequency of combination with other features. Features which share similar progression rates are hypothesized to be linked through the natural process of metonymy (MTA, SV, SBT). Early emergent features are viewed as primary (MTA and MTL). From there, directionality of shift is assessed by comparing co-emergent with post-attestation features. Although no general pattern is discernible on this scale, several case studies of unexpected semantic shift towards minor features as in flummer and flourish show promising results for the field of historical lexical semantics.

This study is an investigation of the phonetic causes of stressed mid and low vowel raising and diphthongization before single palatal consonants and [jC] sequences in the Early Romance languages, as for example [a] raising in Spanish leche derived from Latin [ˈlakte] ‘milk’. The initial hypothesis put to test is that the chances that vowel assimilation applies should increase with the prominence of the anticipatory consonant-to-vowel effects in tongue dorsum raising and fronting and in the second formant (F2) frequency. In accordance with this prediction, vowel assimilatory processes were found to operate most often before [j] + dentoalveolar sequences and single palatals involving maximal dorsal contact in the case of [a] (and to some extent for [ɛ ɔ] as well), and before single palatals rather than before consonant sequences with [j] in the case of [o]. Moreover, assimilation was more prone to affect [ɛ a ɔ o] than the mid high front vowel [e]. The phonetic account of vowel raising and diphthongization reported in the present study complements other explanatory proposals based on chronological and etymological factors. It also supports the notion that the categorization of segmental coarticulatory effects as assimilatory increase with coarticulation size, and that the diachronic vowel changes in question occurred at a time when palatal consonants were in the process of gaining stability.

This article shows that Yukaghir underwent a regular sound change whereby all word-internal and word-final w phonemes became j, probably in Early Proto-Yukaghir. After degemination had occurred, possibly in Middle Proto-Yukaghir, any j in an intervocalic position of disyllabic roots was followed by an epenthetic l, as it still is in the modern Yukaghir languages. Palatalization, labialization, uvularization, and assimilative effects finally formed the Late Proto-Yukaghir forms from which the modern languages have arisen. Word-class prosody controls epenthesis, vowel lengthening, and any further word-final vowel changes. Identifying these historical processes also strengthens the evidence that Yukaghir is genealogically related to Uralic. The Uralic and Yukaghiric correspondences are carefully analyzed as to phonology and semantics, resulting in over fifty new or revised cognate suggestions. Further, Yukaghiric shows a trend towards a reduction of the number of root syllables in the comparison. The semi-vowel w remained unchanged word-initially in Tundra Yukaghir and has thus been a continuous part of the Yukaghir phonemic register. Lexemes containing the semi-vowel w found in modern Yukaghir in word-internal and final positions arose from other sources only after the semi-vowel alternation sound change rule.

10.1075/jhl.6.2.05nur,"Silva Nurmio, David Willis",The rise and fall of a minor category,2017,"
Some languages use a special form of the noun, a “numerative”, after some or all numerals. In such languages, a distinct numerative is typically not available for all nouns, but rather only for a small subset, forming a morphological “minor category” (Corbett 2000). We examine how such a system emerges and disintegrates diachronically, looking in detail at Welsh, a language in which a distinct numerative emerged as the result of the phonological attrition of plural suffixes and analogical extension of new plural suffixes to all relevant syntactic environments except after numerals. Nouns with distinct numeratives tend to be animate and to denote units frequently counted, an association previously noted also for minor duals (Plank 1996). We suggest that this association arose in Welsh via differential analogical extension in two directions: animates resisted analogical extension of the pattern numeral + singular noun; and animates were most receptive to extension of the pattern numeral + numerative. We show that the loss of the numerative proceeded the same way in reverse: numeratives were first reanalyzed as special plurals, and this pattern, numeral + plural noun, resisted analogical spread of the dominant numeral + singular pattern most robustly with kinship terms and a unit of time, namely ‘year’. These developments show much commonality with other cases where the diachrony of the numerative is known, confirming the observation that numeratives typically emerge from the disintegration of a major category, such as plural or dual, and that they are diachronically unstable, liable ultimately to analogical elimination.

This article deals with the patterns of variation and change undergone by a syntactic variable in Early Modern Spanish grammar, namely the alternation between deber ‘have to, must, should’ and deber de + infinitive ‘have to, must, should’ as a modal periphrasis. Based on a 1,500,000-word corpus of immediacy texts (private letters, memories) the results of this variationist study suggest that throughout the 16th century, but more especially during its second half, the prepositional periphrasis gradually became more common, above all in stylistic contexts predominated by the spontaneity and proximity of the relationships between the interlocutors. It was also more frequently found in contexts involving members of northern speech communities, particularly males, the young and the middle-low social strata, the incidence being especially high at the points where some of these groups intersect. All this suggests a change from below in the Golden Age period, which reached considerable dimensions in a relatively short time but was destined to stagnate and later decline just as quickly in the centuries that followed as a result of some structural features, such as the special “visibility” of the preposition, which could have led to the stigmatization of the periphrasis in a similar way to what happened in other Spanish syntactic phenomena.

Old Finnish (1540–1809) shows variation between non-promotional and promotional passives. Historically, there is reason to suppose that the Finnic passive was originally promotional and that a shift to a non-promotional passive already took place during Proto-Finnic times. At first sight, the Old Finnish promotional passive could be based on contact with German, Swedish, and the classical languages — but it could also be a Proto-Finnic remnant conserved partially through these language contacts. To ascertain which is the case, I apply the notion advanced by Timberlake (1977) that a syntactic process of reanalysis and extension will first proceed in contexts which are least marked from the viewpoint of the new analysis, to a corpus of Old Finnish texts. The result is that some texts do indeed exhibit a stepwise generalization of non-promotional passives with, for example, indefinite and divisible arguments. This generalization is restricted to non-periphrastic passives: periphrastic passives are generally promotional. I argue that this state of affairs is best explained by assuming that a Proto-Finnic promotional passive remained in use in the language of the Finnish educated elite until early Old Finnish times, and that the non-promotional passive of Old Finnish is innovative.

The Eskimo-Uralic hypothesis of a genetic link between Eskimo-Aleut and the Uralic languages is now reaching its second centenary. Two major problems with its advancement since Bergsland’s (1959) summary of its status are addressed in this article. The first of these is the lack of an obvious correlate of the ubiquitous Eskimo-Aleut (EA) relative case marker -m in Uralic; the other is the lack of an m-initial first person singular morpheme in EA to correlate with that of the Uralic languages. That the EA singular genitive/relative marker -m — as well as the instrumental/accusative singular -mək based on it — might be cognate with Uralic singular accusative -m was suggested already by Sauvageot (1953), but no firm conclusion on the matter has since been reached. This has remained a tantalizing possibility, despite the conflicting semantics. However, the remarkable morphosyntactic parallels between Eskimo-Aleut and Samoyedic in particular have grown more apparent with recent publications. A solution is proposed, linking the emergence of ergativity in the Eskimo-Aleut family with a reanalysis of the original nominative-accusative case marking system.

The Gothic Bible offers valuable secondary evidence for the pronunciation of Greek in the fourth century AD. However, inferences based on such data may result in a vicious circle, as the interpretation of Gothic is, to a great extent, dependent on the historical details of contemporary Greek. I show that a circular argument can be avoided by using a novel method, which is based on the comparison of transcription correspondences of Greek loan words and biblical names occurring in the Greek original and the Gothic version. I test the method by applying it to three example cases. The first concerns the aspirated stops φ, θ, χ: Gothic evidence confirms the fricativization of these stops. The second case concerns the potential fricativization of voiced stops β, δ, γ: the results are inconclusive, which is an important finding, since this shows that Gothic cannot be used as evidence for the fricativization of these stops. The third case concerns front vowels: Gothic evidence confirms the coalescence of αι and ε on the one hand, and ει and ῑ on the other, while it also indicates that η was not (yet) pronounced as [iː] in the fourth century AD.

This paper investigates the relationship between social and phonetic motivations for language change in Fang (Bantoid). While previous research has proposed that innovations in Fang arose due to social need and lack phonetic motivation (Mve et al. 2019; Good, Di Carlo & Tschonghongei 2020), I propose that there is a phonetic motivation and the social situation, at best, was a pathway for the innovation to gain wider adoption in the population. I provide comparative and language-internal evidence that the Fang innovations are driven by two interconnected processes, palatalization and spirantization, triggered by high vowels. These processes have been obscured synchronically in part due to the phonemic merger of *i > ə in some parts of the paradigm, thus making the alternations look phonetically unmotivated.

Wanderwords are a very common phenomenon among the languages of the world, but they are rarely discussed in
					detail. Their paths of spreading are often considered hardly reconstructible and their origins beyond reach, and being
					non-inherited, they are often ignored by the linguists working on the history of the languages involved. The present article
					questions both these tendencies, as it aims at exploring, as far as possible, the origins and interconnections of a series of
					related words referring to “apples”, “plums”, and other fruits attested in various languages and language families of the Near
					East. The article has two goals. First, to try to reconstruct the borrowing chains and general spread of these terms, thus going
					as close as possible to their putative origin. Second, to provide a test case and an illustration of a general methodological
					framework that can be used to study the history of such wanderwords.

This article gathers a motivated inventory of Old English self-manipulative verbs, including Abstain verbs and Refrain verbs, analyses their semantics and syntax and offers diachronic perspectives on the replacement of that-clause complementation with the from + -ing construction. Such perspectives go in two directions. Firstly, the semantics of the that-clause remains intact throughout the change to the from + -ing construction. Secondly, deverbal nominalisations contribute to the semantics and syntax required by the gerund. The main conclusion is that Refrain verbs are exceptional because the competition leading to the Complement Shift does not hold between finite and non-finite clauses, but between finite clauses and deverbal nominalisations. This has two important consequences: the status of derived nominal linked predications must be acknowledged, and deverbal nominalisations must occupy the top of the syntactic ranking of clause linkage.

Based on a corpus of private correspondence written by twelve influential political and cultural figures in
					eighteenth-century Spain, this article discusses several hypotheses about the role of individual variation in language change. The
					study analyses five variables undergoing change in early modern Spanish and examines the idiolectal use of the traditional
					variants. Several conclusions are drawn from the results. The first is that idiolectal patterns vary considerably from one
					variable to another. Those variants that were clearly in the majority at the time or have undergone slower change processes are
					more consistent with in-between profiles.
On the other hand, those variants that are more clearly declining or undergoing abrupt changes are represented by
					more refractory patterns. Still, these profiles are not uniform, so a specific type of variation in one variant does not exclude
					others. The results concerning the most decisive period in the configuration of the idiolectal distributions are less conclusive,
					mainly due to the imbalances in the representativeness of the samples. However, among the variables better represented in the
					corpus, the end of adolescence – set at 18 in this study – seems to be the most significant, in line with some well-known
					hypotheses in the literature. Nevertheless, we have also detected a few cases of changes in adulthood. Finally, the data support
					the dominance of stability in syntactic variation, suggesting that speakers change little once their idiolectal distributions have
					been established. Even so, some longitudinal changes are found, albeit in a recurrent direction: the replacement of traditional
					forms by alternative, more prestigious variants.

Besides highly grammaticalized analytic verb forms that constitute the system’s main tense, aspect, and mood
					forms, Basque has a handful of less grammaticalized periphrases for secondary aspectual and modal meanings. In both older and more
					recent texts, some of these periphrases have been reanalyzed as monoclausal and readjusted in accordance with the auxiliated
					verb’s argument structure. This readjustment or actualization process involves changes in two respects: case-marking and
					indexation through auxiliary change. The reanalysis and actualization of theses periphrases seem to be driven by analogy with
					highly extended and frequent analytic verb forms. With regard to their actualization, it seems to depend on three factors: word
					order, valency of the auxiliated verb, and plural patient agreement.

In this study, a construction marginally found in Ancient Greek is addressed, namely the participial clause, which is a clause whose main verb is a participle. This construction displays a considerable increase in frequency in Biblical Greek (mainly between the 2nd century bce and the 2nd century ce), which is the language found in Judaeo-Christian literature and which features, in various ways and to various degrees, the influence of Semitic languages. Since the participial clause is a very common construction in these tongues, wherein it even exhibits increasing productivity and frequency at the time at issue, I suggest that the frequency increase observed in Greek should be attributed to the influence of these Semitic languages, with a crucial role played by multilingualism. The issue is addressed from the perspective of language contact, which provides the theoretical and terminological frame by which the phenomenon is individuated and defined.

While the phenomenon of tonogenesis is well represented in the literature, diachronic tone change in already-tonal
					languages has received less attention. This paper considers two types of tonal morphology used to mark the “potential”
					inflectional category on verbs in Coatec Zapotec (aka Di′zhke′). Some verbs are marked with upstep. Coatec upstepped tones are
					emergent tonal contrasts that are developing out of high register allotones which assimilated to a historical high tone on a
					now-deleted preceding syllable. Other verbs display patterns of tone ablaut such that a verb with underlying low or falling tone
					surfaces with high or rising in the potential. Both upstep and tone ablaut in Coatec can be traced to an earlier floating high
					tone that could dock onto different syllables according to a set of ranked constraints. Using a combination of internal and
					comparative reconstruction, details of the earlier tonal system are revealed. This is the first published treatment of
					Proto-Zapotec tone since Swadesh (1947) and the first paper to address tone in
					Proto-Zapotecan and Proto Core Zapotec. *ʔ is revealed to have been a consonant through the Core Zapotec period, suggesting that
					the complex systems of phonation contrasts found in some Central Zapotec languages are a recent development. Cases of tonal
					contrasts developing out of phonation contrasts are known from Southeast Asia, but Zapotec phonation contrasts arose out of
					interaction between the glottal consonant and pre-existing tonal contrasts. An exploration of the morphological environments
					conducive to upstep leads to new discoveries about Zapotecan derivational voice prefixes and reveals the origins of perfective

This study sets out to discuss the evolution from oblique to core case as a manifestation of overtly-marked
					nominative-accusative alignment in Sinitic languages. This is due to the emergence of a type of ‘optional’ marking on preverbal
					direct objects in a construction type that has become widespread in Sinitic (Chappell &
						Verstraete 2019). In particular, I examine spoken discourse data from Taiwanese Southern Min whose comitative
					preposition, ka7
, has grammaticalized into an optional object marker. It is argued that this marker is
					undergoing morphologization into a direct object index (doi) on the main verb in the predicate, subsequent to the
					omission of the resumptive pronoun it governs. The new index takes over this function of cross-referencing the lexical direct
					object, typically located in the immediately preceding discourse, if not in clause-initial position.
In an epilogue, I also briefly treat the evolution of local cases such as the allative and the perlative to
					optional object markers in the Southern Min languages of Shantou and Jieyang, situated in Guangdong Province, China. Both of these
					are extremely rare sources in the Sinitic family, yet common in Tibeto-Burman and Romance languages. The approach adopted is in
					harmony with recent diachronic studies which target source morphosyntax in order to explain the emergence of a variety of
					synchronic patterns, all bearing similar discourse and grammatical functions (Cristofaro &

Polarity reversal has recently been argued to be the defining characteristic of counterfactuality. Ancient Greek
					had a diverse set of constructions which bring about polarity reversal that is not the direct result of a negation marker nor do
					they all express a counterfactual meaning. It is the aim of this paper to detail the major differences between these constructions
					synchronically and especially diachronically, focusing on counterfactual mood forms, counterfactual modal verbs, avertives
					(almost+past (im)perfective), non-counterfactual rhetorical questions and non-standard wishes. As a historically varied
					constructional group, these constructions bring about polarity reversal in different ways with different implicatures (e.g.,
					counterfactual, contradictory, undesirable), but they most importantly differ in their diachronic conventionalization of polarity
					reversal. Whereas counterfactuals conventionalize their polarity reversal in various ways (e.g., changing temporal reference,
					counterfactual implicature transfer), non-counterfactual polarity reversal constructions create polarity reversal as a synchronic
					implicature through pragmatic means (e.g., a rhetorical question identifying a contradictory presupposition in the common ground
					or a non-standard wish evaluating an undesirable outcome to the speaker).

Some North American indigenous languages have names for ‘common nighthawk’ (Chordeiles minor)’, ‘robin’, and ‘bird’ that are strikingly similar phonetically and have served to advocate long-distance genetic relationships among language families. While the Algonquian proto-form for ‘nighthawk’ has a rather straightforward pedigree, this is not the case for Siouan languages. Despite their phonetic resemblance, the ornithonyms for ‘nighthawk’ in half a dozen Siouan languages are unrelated; some are mimetic innovations and others are borrowed. This article analyses how and why ornithonyms are problematic in the application of the comparative method, a reality that affects the validity of long-distance claims, and offers alternative ways to deal with this issue. While ornithonyms can be inherited and undergo all the regular sound changes (or not) like other words, they are also problematic in many respects. First, they can be onomatopoetic and imitate the cry or call of the bird in question – a feature that accounts for their cross-linguistic similarity. Second, they can undergo ad hoc mimetic reshaping or become lexically contaminated based on phonetic similarity with other ornithonyms or words with which they are associated culturally. Third and last, they can be borrowed internally or externally. However, despite these comparative pitfalls (i.e., that some phonetically similar forms in a language family are not cognates), the analysis shows that our understanding of ornithological nomenclature can be enhanced by considering elements of ornithology, mythology, ethnographic knowledge, sayings, and puns pertaining to birds.

					of functions it covers. In this paper, we give an account of different case functions of ‘rā’, in New Persian, an
					era from the 8th century (C.E.) to present. To analyze the functionality of ‘rā’ in different texts, we selected
					78 books from the New and Contemporary Persian eras and studied one thousand tokens of ‘rā’ from each century.
					The data show that ‘rā’ has been a polyfunctional case marker in New Persian, marking about 13 different case
					roles. Its main role was to mark direct objects, and gradually it has become its sole function in Contemporary Persian. However,
					during the time span, some of the ‘rā’-marked roles remained constant and some of them replaced
						‘rā’ with other adpositions. We follow a historical semantic map approach as a typological grid to examine
					our data. The findings show that ‘rā’ has shifted from animate to inanimate concepts gradually. While in the 12th
					century about 750 out of 1000 (about 75%) roles marked with ‘rā’ were animate, it has decreased to about 400 out
					of 1000 (about 42%) in the 19th century and less than 30% in the 20th century. Our data show that ‘rā’ has not

While previous studies have analyzed the changing nature of polarity items (PIs) in Latin (see Gianollo 2018, 2020) and the licensing conditions of PIs in modern languages (see Homer 2021), less research has analyzed the diachronic behavior of PIs in the development of the Spanish language. The present study takes a quantitative approach to historical corpus data in showing that in older varieties of Spanish, there was an increased degree of competition between items of the alg- series (i.e., alguno ‘some’) and items of the n- series (i.e., ninguno ‘none’) in negated clauses which later decreased as the language entered its modern age. We find that the competition between these items in negated clauses is influenced by factors such as register, the syntactic role of the PI, and activation status (following Larrivée 2012, 2017). These data provide quantitative support for Martins (2000), who suggested that earlier forms of Spanish exhibited more versatile licensing conditions of PIs, and that this variation gradually decreased over time due to a greater salience of the n- series in negated clauses. In total, the present work aims to use corpus data to connect historical linguistic research to theoretical approaches regarding the contemporary usage of PIs.

This study sets out several phonological features in Caijia that are notable from a diachronic point of view. The Caijia language is an endangered language spoken in northwestern Guìzhōu, China. It was first formally documented in the early 1980s and is generally viewed as a Sinitic language. Some aspects of Caijia phonology are noteworthy from the perspective of historical phonology. There exist features which cannot be accounted for in terms of Middle Chinese (MC), such as the retention of the contrast between Old Chinese (OC) T-type and L-type onsets in words with d- or dr- in Middle Chinese. Moreover, Caijia also demonstrates features which are observed or preserved in Middle Chinese, but absent in mainstream modern Sinitic varieties, including the retention of bilabial stops in words with initials Fēi/Fū/Fèng.

The present study contributes to the description of the coding of anticausatives and causative-anticausative
					alternation in Classical Armenian based on conventional typologically-oriented questionnaires and a dataset of verbs attested in
					the Armenian translation of the Bible. The synchronic evidence is then analyzed from a diachronic perspective with an outlook on
					modern varieties of Armenian and the Proto-Indo-European reconstruction.
It is argued that discriminating between the derivational and inflectional tiers allows for a better explanation
					of the morphological links between the patterns used to code causative-anticausative alternation in verbs of different semantic
					types. According to preliminary quantitative estimations, the overall valency orientation of Classical Armenian is dominated by a
					nondirected equipollent coding strategy. Altogether, when coded by transitivizing pairs, causative-anticausative alternation shows
					preference for noncausal verbs of the a-conjugation, the paradigm of which typically combines equipollent
					perfective forms with labile imperfective ones.
An improved descriptive model enables a better cross-linguistic alignment of coding patterns as illustrated by
					comparing Classical Armenian to other cognate languages. Classical Armenian provides additional evidence on the typologically
					common split in the coding of causative-anticausative pairs. Whereas the transitivizing and equipollent (and marginally
					suppletive) patterns are diachronically stable within the prehistory of Armenian, the labile strategy constitutes a major
					innovation typical for the imperfective part of the verbal paradigm.

This paper explores the operation of child language acquisition as a critical factor in some forms of language change. It proposes a sociohistorical model that incorporates the potential for young children to function as linguistic agents in certain environments, characterized by unpredictable variation in the input, lack of normative mechanisms, and the possibility for the emergence of peer networks among children. The model is then applied to explain a well-documented but poorly understood phonological change in the history of Latin American Spanish: the simplification of the system of sibilants in 16th-century Colonial Spanish. This change was nestled in ecological environments characterized by intense contact among L1 and L2 speakers of several varieties of Iberian and non-Iberian languages, as well as the rapid breakdown and reshaping of social networks. We argue that, in the absence of strong normative pressures, the advantages of certain options for early acquisition were crucial in the eventual creation and generalization of a new sociolinguistic norm. This study is methodologically innovative in that it combines not just archival evidence and sociohistorical information, but also present-day acquisitional data. The latter offers a piece often missing in sociohistorical accounts of language change.

                    Chatino may be a factor in the retention of preconsonantal *n in Zapotec varieties spoken to the south. A fuller stative prefix,
                    usually *na-, arose later from a grammaticalized form of the stative-marked copula (Munro
                        2007; Uchihara 2021). *na- is more productive than *n- and
                    provides the basis for a new proposed “Eastern Zapotec” genetic grouping. However, the isogloss for *na- crosscuts the earlier
                    isogloss for preconsonantal nasal deletion, showing that any model of Zapotecan linguistic history needs to address not only

The present discussion proposes that renewal processes in the domain of negation manifest themselves predominantly
                    in the change from bi-morphemic, synthetic negation to analytic negation neg+aux by introducing a new auxiliary verb as
                    verbal head. Some of these new verbs may subsequently be merged with the negator resulting into new bi-morphemic negation. The
                    proposed analyticization process accounts for different kinds of complex negation, including aspectual and modal negation, the
                    copula and negative focus markers. I propose a unified mechanism for the morpho-syntactic processes, which change the system of
                    negation in Chinese. Two morpho-syntactic factors contribute to this particular grammaticalization process of Chinese: (1) the
                    diachronically consistent head initial word order within the functional and the lexical (CP/vP) domains (with the
                    exception of sentence-final particles); and (2) the morpho-phonological rule that negation has to attach directly to aux,
                    i.e., to a weak verbal head. Based on particularly the second constraint, I propose that only the combination
                        neg+aux
mod leads to the emergence of new fused negators constituting the head of a Negative/Modal phrase,
                    i.e., a negative phrase (NegP) with modal features. The renewal process of the verbal heads of bi-morphemic negation is caused by
                    semantic bleaching and an increasing intransparency of the negator which triggers the grammaticalization of new (often defective)
                    lexical verbs via upward movement from the lexical to the functional domain. It accounts for the grammaticalization of the

Prior to widespread contact with Russian, Khanty (Uralic; Finno-Ugric) did not have overt conjunctions or phrasal
          coordination. Instead, Khanty texts from the late 19th–early 20th centuries only include examples of conjunction-less clausal juxtaposition,
          which was used for both clausal and phrasal coordination. By comparing Khanty texts over the 20th century, we trace the emergence of overt
          conjunctions and coordination of phrasal constituents. We show that overt conjunctions first appeared in the context of clausal
          coordination, followed by coordination of smaller phrases. Based on novel elicitation data, we demonstrate that, in contemporary Khanty, (i)
          overt conjunctions are commonplace, (ii) coordinated clausal constituents may be derived via phrasal coordination or clausal coordination
          with conjunction reduction/ellipsis, but (iii) ellipsis of syntactic heads is banned (nouns & postpositions) or dispreferred (verbs).
          Based on this diachronic picture, we conclude that the coordination of phrasal constituents only emerged in Khanty once overt conjunctions
          became available. We derive this correlation from the Maximize On-line Processing principle (Hawkins
            2004), and show that this maxim, usually invoked in the context of speech planning and production, can be successfully applied to
          modelling language change.

10.1075/jhl.21003.wan,"Florian Wandl, Darya Kavitskaya",On the reconstruction of contrastive secondary palatalization in Common Slavic,2022,"
Contrastive secondary palatalization is a feature typically associated with Slavic. However, this contrast is
                    present only in some contemporary Slavic languages, such as Ukrainian, Eastern Bulgarian, Russian, and Upper and Lower Sorbian.
                    Thus, a question arises as to whether the secondary palatalization contrast represents a Common Slavic inheritance, and how it
                    should be reconstructed. Providing such a reconstruction is important for the field of Slavic historical phonology, as well as for
                    the general understanding of the development of consonant inventories with palatal consonants and the development of secondary
                    palatalization contrasts in the world’s languages. By considering several historical scenarios, we show that /r/ : /rj/
                    is the only secondary palatalization contrast that can be reconstructed to a pre-stage common to all of Slavic. While pursuing the
                    reconstruction, we use supporting evidence from the typology of sound change and the typology of consonantal inventories in the
                    world’s languages, as well as relative chronology.

Through comparison of regular sound correspondences in three closely related Tibeto-Burman (TB) languages, Ersu,
                    Lizu, and Duoxu (collectively “ELD”), informed by external comparison with other TB languages and recent phonetic analyses of the
                    production of voiceless nasals, we reconstruct *fricative-nasal sequences in their common ancestor, Proto-ELD.
In the development of these historic clusters, two pathways of change can be recognized. Their difference lies in
                    the divergent relative phasing of velic and oral gestures in the original fricative-nasal sequences:


(i)

fricative weakening (from a tight cluster): *FN > N̥ > h̃ > x



(ii)

fricative strengthening (from a loose cluster): *F-n > *F-t > t > k or *F‑n > s



The different reflexes observed in Ersu, Lizu, and Duoxu represent different points along these two developmental
                    pathways. These reconstructions and pathways of development have implications for our understanding of both universal (phonetic)
                    and language-specific aspects of change in fricative-nasal sequences. The first pathway makes it possible to explore the process
                    of nasal devoicing beyond voiceless nasals so as to enrich our understanding of nasal devoicing in natural languages. The
                    co-existence of two opposite pathways of change, on the other hand, provides insights into the morphological and syllabic
                    structure of words with contiguous fricative-nasal sequences in ELD languages at different points in time – insights that may be
                    valuable in examining the history of other languages and language families beyond the ELD cluster.

In this article, we present the first quantitative study of what we call multiple unconditioned reflexes (MUR) in
					Bantu, more specifically of Proto-Bantu velar stops *k and *g in the West-Coastal Bantu (WCB) branch of the Bantu language family.
					MUR, also known as “doubles reflexes” in Bantu studies, represent a situation where one and the same proto-sound has two or more
					reflexes in a given language which cannot be accounted for by phonological conditioning and/or lexical borrowing. This diachronic
					irregularity has been explained in Bantu historical linguistics, and Niger-Congo studies more broadly, by reconstructing either an
					additional series of consonants (phonemic merger) or a latent conditioning that went lost (phonemic split). We show that MUR
					should not be explained, but rather taken as an indicator of the same pervasive irregularity of sound change reported in other
					parts of the world that are highly multilingual and lack a neat overlap between distinct languages and communities. Along with
					widespread multilingualism, we assess lexical diffusion, substrate influence, and spread-over-spread events in Bantu language
					history as complementary explanations for the rise of MUR in WCB.

There sentences in extreme southern Italy",2022,"
Among the morpho-syntactic patterns by which Italo-Romance varieties code there sentences, a
					peculiar structure surfaces in extreme southern varieties, particularly in Salento and in southern Calabria: this involves an
					invariable 3rd person form of the outcome of habēre as the copula, with no agreement with the postcopular nominal, the
					so-called pivot. Even though this pattern is attested in other Romance languages too, it proves, however, to be peculiar, insofar
					as it hosts top-ranking definite NPs (especially 1st and 2nd person pronouns), which are generally disallowed within ‘to have’
						there sentences in the Romance varieties. In the present paper, we infer that this pattern depends on the
					contact with Italo-Greek, which displays similar constructions, with an invariant 3rd sg. form of ‘to have’, the lack of the
					proform and the pivot marked as accusative. However, a diachronic investigation reveals that neither the extreme southern
					Italo-Romance varieties nor Italo-Greek displayed in their Medieval stage a similar construction, since both of them exhibited the
					definiteness effect. Sociolinguistic factors can account for how the two systems influenced each other by ruling out the
					definiteness effect from the respective patterns at the end of the interference process.

This study uses word embeddings to investigate the semantic changes underlying the creation of two adversative connectives in Portuguese, porém and mas ‘but, however’. For porém, we chart its development from an original PP formed by a preposition with a causal meaning (por) and a demonstrative pronoun that referred anaphorically to a previous proposition (en(de)). For mas, we trace its change from an adverb meaning ‘more’. Adopting a distributional semantics approach, we use word embedding models trained on two corpora, the CIPM (Corpus Informatizado do Português Medieval, containing texts from the 12th–16th centuries) and COLONIA (containing texts from the 16th–20th centuries). We produce a measure of change based on the similarity scores of porém and mas with respect to words in relevant semantic categories in each corpus, representing the source and the target meanings. This paper, which constitutes the first computational study of semantic change in Portuguese, also discusses challenges and outlines steps to be taken into consideration when choosing embedding algorithms for small historical corpora.

There is considerable literature on dative subject or non-canonical subject marking constructions in Japanese, and
					yet they have been studied mainly from a synchronic point of view. This paper investigates the diachronic dimension of
					non-canonical case marking constructions in Japanese. Following Yanagida and Whitman
						(2009), I assume that Old Japanese (700–800 A.D.) displays split active alignment. This paper argues that dative
					subjects arose as a byproduct of a change occurring from active-inactive to accusative alignment. A factor triggering this change
					was the reanalysis of some particular object experiencer predicates as intransitives due to the loss of the vestigial causative
					suffix associated with the predicate. Synchronically, these constructions involve a voice alternation of the type identified as
					the psych causative alternation by Alexiadou and Iordăchioaia (2014): object
					experiencer verbs behave parallel to causative verbs whereas alternating subject experiencer verbs behave parallel to
					anticausative verbs.
