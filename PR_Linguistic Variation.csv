This paper offers novel insights on articlelessness in noun phrases in Dutch and German headlines. Modified noun
					phrases that lack a determiner in headlines exhibit adjectival agreement that cannot be explained if one assumes an article that
					is phonologically null or that has been PF-deleted. We describe the pattern, consider different analytical options and eventually
					conclude that the interpretation, distribution as well as the observed adjectival agreement characteristic of articlelessness noun
					phrases calls for an account in which the article is never projected to begin with.

10.1075/lv.22006.esp,"M. Teresa Espinal, Cristina Real-Puigdollers, Xavier Villalba",From a movement verb to an epistemic discourse marker,"The diachronic change of Spanish vaya
",2022,"
Besides its main use as a form of the movement verb ir ‘to go’, the Spanish form vaya (lit. go) is also used as a verbal discourse marker. Here we trace this transition from a purely verbal form to a discourse marker by searching a historical corpus of documents in Spanish, which reveals the increasing use over time of vaya in exclamatives to replace a presentational construction. We focus on vaya in isolation and in combination with an indefinite DP or a bare NP. We analyze the meaning of vaya as an epistemic discourse marker, by means of which the speaker expresses a judgment, a subjective epistemic and evidential evaluation of a proposition accessible from context. We postulate that these constructions sit in a Judgment Phrase at the syntactic-pragmatic interface (Krifka 2020), a position to which vaya also moves when its meaning is that of an expressive intensifier that directly modifies over one or more (contextually salient) properties of the noun contained in the DP/NP.

Despite an increasing interest in German dialect syntax, the study of article use in Upper German (Alemannic and
					Bavarian) remains a desideratum. This is true in particular for Austrian varieties. The present study focusses on article
					variation and change in Austrian Upper German and discusses the status of article grammaticalization. To that effect, ‘radical’
					cases of article use in Upper German are analysed, i.e. cases considered incorrect in standard German: the use of indefinite
					articles before mass nouns, of definite articles before proper nouns, and of indefinite articles in the plural. These phenomena
					are investigated by means of a comprehensive dialect survey (3,599 dialect translations by 163 dialect speakers from 40 research
					locations). The analysis examines inner-linguistic factors (lexis, semantics, syntax) as well as extra-linguistic factors (dialect
					areas, age group). The findings reveal a surprisingly high variability and a relatively advanced stage of grammaticalization in
					some areas, especially Central Bavarian dialects.

",2022,"
This article sketches a new analysis of the diachronic development found in many West Germanic languages from a
					hybrid VO-OV order to a rigid OV or VO order. The discussion departs from the discussions in Struik & Van Kemenade (2020/2022) and Struik & Schoenmakers (to appear) on the diachronic development of English/Dutch, which focus on the
					role of object shift and information structure. My interpretation of their data will be based on an earlier analysis of the
					Germanic OV and VO languages in Broekhuis (2008: § 2.4; 2011). The main conclusions are the following. First, the change from the historical hybrid VO-OV systems
				    to the rigid OV and VO systems of the present-day languages is due to changing the “setting” [±V‑to‑v] to the
					more categorical ones [−V-to-v] or [+V-to-v]. Second, the role of object shift in the diachronic
					development is modest; it is not involved in the development of the OV-languages at all and involves only the (partial) loss of
					object shift in the VO-languages (contra Struik et al.). Third, the encoding of the information-structural
						new-given distinction remains constant in that the interpretation of (un)scrambled nominal objects does not
					change over time (contra Struik & Schoenmakers).

The present article is dedicated to conative animal calls (CACs) in a Kalahari Khoe language, Tjwao. By using a
					prototype approach to categorization, the authors test the Tjwao CACs for their compliance with the prototype of CACs posited
					recently in scholarly literature. The authors conclude that Tjwao CACs largely conform to the pragma-semantic, phonetic, and
					morphological properties associated with CACs across languages. In light of the Tjwao data, a few refinements are also proposed.
					These concern the potential prevalence of whistles as the most common sounds not included in the International Phonetic Alphabet,
					the correlation of summonses with replication and repetitions as well as front and/or close vowels, the higher frequency of
					summonses and dispersals among all semantic types of CACs, and the lesser extent of monosemy than previously claimed.

", ,2022,"
The second person pronouns in Spanish have exhibited numerous variants along its history, not only regarding its stressed forms, but also the agreement that emerges in the inflecting elements that anchor these stressed pronouns. Despite the quantity of studies carried out about voseo, tuteo and ustedeo, none of them has argued what grammatical reasons underlie for so much variation, since they have focused on pragmatic and sociolinguistic patterns without going any further than a mere description. In this article, I aim to account for the linguistic features that have triggered all variants and person disagreements, for every case has undergone the same grammatical process.
