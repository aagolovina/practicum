10.1075/lv.20015.mun,Carlos Muñoz Pérez,Towards a syntactic understanding  of connective particles,The final pero phenomenon in Bahiense Spanish,2022,"
The contrastive connector pero ‘but’ is rigidly sentence-initial in most Spanish varieties. However, at least three Spanish dialects allow locating it at the end of a sentence. This paper discusses the properties of final pero as attested in the dialect spoken in Bahia Blanca (Argentina), i.e., the so-called pero bahiense. First, I demonstrate that pero bahiense cannot be reduced to superficially similar phenomena in Spanish. Then, I offer a comparison between pero bahiense and its sentence-initial counterpart showing that they share a number of non-trivial characteristics but also differ in relevant regards. Based on these properties, I advance an account of the pero bahiense phenomenon according to which instances of pero that express concessivity may optionally attract the CP projection to their left. While the analysis does not cover all properties of pero bahiense, it highlights aspects of the syntax of connective particles that require further investigation.

The present article is dedicated to conative animal calls (CACs) in a Kalahari Khoe language, Tjwao. By using a
					prototype approach to categorization, the authors test the Tjwao CACs for their compliance with the prototype of CACs posited
					recently in scholarly literature. The authors conclude that Tjwao CACs largely conform to the pragma-semantic, phonetic, and
					morphological properties associated with CACs across languages. In light of the Tjwao data, a few refinements are also proposed.
					These concern the potential prevalence of whistles as the most common sounds not included in the International Phonetic Alphabet,
					the correlation of summonses with replication and repetitions as well as front and/or close vowels, the higher frequency of
					summonses and dispersals among all semantic types of CACs, and the lesser extent of monosemy than previously claimed.

10.1075/lv.21004.ter,"Alexandra Ter-Avanesova, Michael Daniel",The second genitive in the history  of Russian and across its dialects, ,2022,"
In this paper, we provide a survey of the diachronic development of the Russian second genitive (Gen2). As
					endpoints of this development, we consider data from Russian dialects representing different dialect groups. Assumedly, the
					expansion of Gen2 started off as ‘recycling’ of the genitive of a declension type that became obsolete already in the pre-written
					period. Nouns of this declension type were adopted by another declension, carrying their old genitive over as a variant form. This
					alternative ending started spreading, always as a variant, to other nouns in the adoptive declension. As the survey of the
					literature shows, in the course of this expansion new constraints evolved, including phonological, morphophonological,
					phonotactic, syntactic and semantic conditioning. While there is no declension class or even individual nouns where Gen2 became
					the only option, it expanded to different extents in different dialects. We believe that the diversity of functions associated
					with the form, the range of language-internal factors driving its expansion, as well as the current geographic distribution of
					constraints on its formation weaken the claim that emergence of Gen2 as a morphological category dedicated to partitive was due to
					contact with the languages of the Circumbaltic area, a suggestion made on a macro-areal basis and also based on comparison with
					the northern dialects alone. While we cannot argue that the data we present disproves the contact factor, we would at least expect
					that the increased granularity of dialectal data would provide some data to support it. This is not what happens, which we
					consider to be an argument against contact-induced change.
The aim of the paper is two-fold: to present a synopsis of the discussions of the history of Gen2 and a survey of
					the data on the use of Gen2 in the dialects, both firsthand and available from the literature; and to question the role of contact
					in the emergence of the new category of Gen2 in Russian.

The article takes a closer look at the partitive genitive constructions in Latvian, their structure, semantics, and syntactic functions. With the help of a corpus analysis, an attempt has been made to find out what determines gender and number agreement variations between the partitive genitive constructions in subject position and the predicate, if it comprises a declinable participle. Attention was paid to such features as subject animacy, voice of the predicate, word order (SV / VS), quantifier lexeme and grammatical number of the genitive. 320 examples with partitive genitive constructions were selected from The Balanced Corpus of Modern Latvian LVK2018, including such quantifier lexemes as daļa ‘part’, skaits ‘number’, vairums ‘quantity’, vairākums ‘majority’, puse ‘half’, daudzums ‘amount / quantity’, lērums ‘bagful’, simts ‘hundred’, tūkstotis ‘thousand’, daudz ‘much/many’, maz ‘little / few’. The best results are given by the combination of values ‘animate’, ‘active’ and ‘SV’, in which 93.24% of the examples are partitive genitive agreement. Data analyzed so far suggest that quantifiers involving the semantic element of partitivity (e.g., daļa ‘part’) favor partitive genitive agreement, whereas quantifiers lacking this semantic element favor quantifier agreement. This is an exploratory quantitative study on agreement tendencies in Latvian.

This article discusses the emergence of the partitive case in the three western-most branches of the Uralic
                    language family, which are Saamic and Finnic in North Europe, and Mordvinic in Central Russia. The Finnic languages represent the
                    outer edge of development in the partitive from an earlier ablative case, which used to manifest ‘source’, a specific property of
                    spatial relations. In Finnic the partitive case is a multifunctional and conceptually distinct case, an inflectional category
                    which has developed highly specific functions in object marking, negative phrase and as a case of non-canonical subject. Traces of
                    this development are found in Saamic and Mordvinic as well, whereas other Uralic languages don’t share this kind of secondary
                    development and functional extension. The development of this particular affix consists of several stages, special bottlenecks,
                    enhancing functional properties and triggering the reanalysis of an inherited affix *-ta/-tä. This article focuses on the
                    diachrony of this particular affix with special emphasis on western Uralic.

This paper examines a structure in the Bantu language Kinande, namely the so-called sociative causative, where partitive morphology occurs on a nominal without giving the nominal an NP-related partitive interpretation. We argue that the source of the partitivity in this construction lies in the co-extensiveness relation (incrementality relation) between the causing and the caused subevent. Partitive morphology on the nominal signals obligatory licensing of the theme so that it can be properly mapped to the co-extensive subevents.

We investigate optional predicate agreement in Santiago Tz’utujil (Mayan). Several generalizations emerge: (i) inanimate
          arguments base-generated as complements control agreement optionally; (ii) some animate arguments base-generated as complements control
          agreement optionally; (iii) all arguments base-generated as specifiers control full agreement obligatorily. We propose that two conditions

          a goal must be visible (bear the right feature). Second, a goal must be accessible (be in the right structural position). If one or both
          conditions are not met, Agree fails, but the derivation converges and 3sg agreement is exponed. While Agree is

In this paper we provide a comprehensive picture of differential object marking in Catalan, focusing on both the empirical
					facts and their theoretical contribution. We support some important conclusions. First, Catalan differential object marking is quite a
					robust and widespread phenomenon, contrary to what prescriptive grammars assume. Second, we show that, from a formal perspective, Catalan
					differential object marking cannot be completely subsumed under hierarchical generalizations known as scales. The
					contribution of narrow syntax mechanisms and nominal structure is fundamental, supporting recent views by López (2012) or Ormazabal and Romero (2007, 2010, 2013a, b), a.o. Building
					on these works as well as on observations initially made by Cornilescu (2000) and Rodríguez-Mondoñedo (2007), a.o., we adopt an analysis under which canonical, animacy-based
					differential marking results from the presence of an additional (PERSON) feature, beyond Case. This structural make-up is not only at the
					core of differences marked objects exhibit from unmarked objects with a Case feature, but also derives the prominence of differential
					marking on (animates) under information-structure processes, in the high left (and right) periphery, in contexts of the type discussed by
					Escandell-Vidal (2007a, b, 2009).

According to Rizzi & Bocci’s (2017) suggested hierarchy of the left periphery, fronted foci (FOC) can never precede polarity complementizers (PolC); yet languages like Bulgarian and Macedonian appear to display precisely such an ordering configuration. On the basis of a cross-linguistic comparison of ten Slavic languages, I argue that in the Slavic subgroup the possibility of having a focus precede PolC is dependent on the morphological properties of the complementizer itself: in languages where the order FOC < PolC is acceptable, PolC is a complex morpheme derived through the incorporation of a lower functional head with a higher one. The order FOC < PolC is then derived by giving overt spell-out to the intermediate copy of PolC rather than to the topmost one. In turn, this option is linked to the possibility, recorded in all languages which allow for FOC < PolC, to also realize the morpheme expressing interrogative polarity as an enclitic particle attaching to fronted foci.

10.1075/lv.20002.toq,Luis Miguel Toquero-Pérez,Revisiting extraction and subextraction patterns from arguments, ,2021,"
Extraction and subextraction tend to receive separate attention in syntax, which leads to the assumption that they
					should be analyzed independently, even though they both illustrate an asymmetry between subjects and objects. By looking at
					various phenomena in English, German, Spanish and Norwegian I propose that this parallel behavior is not accidental, but that
					there is a previously unnoticed generalization: subextraction is allowed iff extraction is possible and the target of
					subextraction is not an indirect object. I propose that a revised version of Spec-to-Spec antilocality (Erlewine 2016) is necessary: movement of and out of an XP must cross a Projection Line
						(PL) (Brody 1998), i.e. the set of all projections of a head. This
					version of antilocality can derive Freezing effects, Huang’s
						(1982)
CED, and their exceptions; and Comp-trace effects and their
					neutralization, extending them to subextraction. However, antilocality on its own cannot derive the extraction-subextraction
					asymmetry in indirect objects. I propose that the Principle of Minimal Compliance (PMC) (Richards 1998) can suspend antilocality if agree between a probe and a goal has happened. The version adopted here
					will allow extraction of the whole XP, but disallow extraction of its specifier due to the lack of an agree relation. Antilocality
					and the PMC combined also make the right predictions in other domains such as the lack of do-support in matrix
					subject questions and A-movement of the subject in declarative clauses, providing evidence that antilocality is a constraint that
					should apply to (at least) both A and A′-movement.

In some limited cases, English allows a particular preposition to combine with a certain kind of subordinate clause, as
          exemplified by in that in “I take the proposal seriously, in that I loathe it”. In contrast, Norwegian systematically
          allows prepositions to combine with subordinate clauses (as in Det resulterte i at vi vant, literally “It resulted in that
          we won”). I argue that the English case should be handled as the subcategorization for a certain complement class by a particular lexical
          entry, while the Norwegian case indicates that the extended projection of clauses can continue up to the preposition. This highlights an
          important difference between lexical selection and extended projection, revealing a hitherto underappreciated source of parametric
          variation, and sheds light on several properties of extended projections as well as of prepositions. Specifically, the extended projections

Circumpositions in Afrikaans present several puzzles: (i) they always encode spatial paths, but spatial paths can
                    also be encoded by prepositional phrases; (ii) they can be doubling or non-doubling, and (iii) they exhibit disharmonic word order
                    of the kind that appears to violate the Final-over-Final Condition (FOFC). In this paper, I argue that circumpositions offer
                    support for the existence of a directional head [dir] in the fine structure of the Afrikaans verbal
                        domain, and that this head is lexicalised by adpositional material in circumpositional expressions. I show that
                    Afrikaans grammar distinguishes Route-paths from Goal-/Source-paths, and argue that whereas [dir] selects a
                        [pathP] in the structure underlying Goal-/Source-paths (circumpositional expressions), Route-paths (prepositional
                    expressions) are ‘bare’ [pathP] structures. I argue that since circumpositions identify structural components in
                    different Spellout Domains, double-insertion of adposition-like material is required to exhaustively lexicalise the structure, and
                    the disharmonic word order is understood as a direct consequence of the fact that [dir] is located in Afrikaans’
                    head-final verbal, which addresses the concern arising around FOFC. Finally, given that the adpositions in circumpositional
                    expressions are shown to occupy structural positions that are distinct from that of de-adpositional V-particles, the paper also
                    addresses the structural relation between circumpositions and particle verbs in which adposition-like material lexicalises a
                    resultative [res] node in the verbal domain.

This paper proposes a minimalist analysis of locative prepositions in Central Catalan, from a comparative perspective.
          Specifically, I claim that certain semantic and syntactic properties that are usually considered part of the field of the extended

          the complement of a preposition. This claim takes the view that adpositions are a functional projection that relates two DPs, the Figure and
          the Ground, and not a lexical head that projects a functional domain on its own, as Ns, Vs or As (cf. den Dikken 2010; Koopman 2000). The final part of the paper proposes a model to account
          for the variation that locative prepositions exhibit across Romance languages following the Conjecture of Borer (1984) (known as the Borer-Chomsky Conjecture since Baker 2008).

Based mostly on the Romance languages, we provide evidence for the conclusion that oblique adpositions involved in

                    relators, relating a complement to an event by establishing an inclusion relation between them. Locatives are specializations of

However, unlike satellite-framed languages, pl spatial prefixes are incompatible with manner of motion verbs, which do not inherently encode path information, but they can only be used with directed motion verbs where the path information is available in the lexical semantics of the verb. Given this pattern, complementing Acedo-Matellán (2016)’s classification of weak vs. strong satellite-framed languages, we argue that verb-framed languages are also of two types. While languages like Romance are strong verb-framed languages encoding Path directly in the verb root, pl constitutes an example of a weak verb-framed language, where Path is affixal and forms a single word with the verb.

While much work has been done on the description of the mass/count distinction in different geographical areas, Brazilian Indigenous languages are still highly underrepresented in the field. This paper presents the results of a project that involved researchers describing the mass/count distinction in 15 Brazilian Indigenous languages, based on a questionnaire we prepared in 2016 in order to explore the distribution of bare nouns, plurals, numerals, and quantifiers (see Appendix). Three main observations will be drawn. First, number marking and countability are independent. Second, counting is not restricted to natural atoms. Third, since there seems to be no systematic symmetry in the distribution of plurals, numerals, and quantifiers, we argue that the standard diagnostics for countable vs. non-countable nouns are highly language-specific.

Our results show that Dâw is a bare argument language, with no plural on nouns or numeral classifiers, in which all nouns can be counted directly without the need of a measure or container phrase.

The Maxakalí language lacks additive plurals (akin to dog-s) on nouns, but has associative plurals, and a large set of suppletive verbs that indicate whether the internal argument is plural or not. Although it has no plural marking, Maxakalí distinguishes between count nouns and mass nouns. The former can be followed by numerals, while the latter must be coerced or occur with container words. Only count nouns can be distinguished between singular and plural with verbal number. Mass nouns always require plural verbal number. Count nouns are compatible with words like ‘many’ indicating cardinality, while mass nouns are compatible with words like ‘big’ for volume. Granulated substances have variable behavior, depending on whether treated as a whole or as several individuated items. Numerals in Maxakalí show an unusual pattern, whereby 1–3 are treated as unaccusative verbs, and 4 and up, being loanwords, are treated as unergative verbs.

Though there is no formal differentiation between count and mass nouns in Mẽbengokre, a Jê language from central

In this paper we show that Guajajára has grammaticalized the distinction between mass and count nouns, but that the coding
          of this distinction is different from the systems of coding in classifier languages, number-marking languages, and number-neutral languages
            (Chierchia 1998a, 1998b, 2010; Wilhelm 2008). As a result, we conclude that Guajajára presents a
          challenge to the tripartite classification of languages proposed in Chierchia’s work, since Guajajára number marking is non-inflectional and
          optional when plural is already expressed by other quantificational expressions. Furthermore, in Guajajára notional mass nouns can pluralize
          and directly combine with numerals without the mediation of container or measure constructions in contexts where conventional and
          non-conventional container and units of measurement are implied. This last observation suggests that coercion is not a mechanism that

This paper examines the count-mass distinction in Terena (Aruák, Brazil) by focusing on plural marking availability, numeral and quantifier distribution and cardinal versus volume interpretation in quantity judgment tests. The data collected from the initial research of these features in Terena reveals the relevancy of the count-mass distinction in the language with some signature properties: (i) only count nouns can be directly combined with numerals; (ii) only count nouns can be used with the quantifier êno with the interpretarion of many individuals rather than a large quantity; and finally, (iii) only count nouns can express cardinality of individuals in a comparative sentence such as John has more N than Peter. Plural morpheme distribution is unsuitable for distinguishing count from mass nouns (such as in English) since mass nouns can be pluralized in Terena, provided noun denotations have individuals to allow for number rather than volume quantity interpretation.

Nouns such as wyn ‘water’ do not combine with numerals, whereas other words such as baydkury ‘jaguar’ do.

This paper presents a model that connects phonotactic exceptionality to perceptibility, more specifically to

                    where the former is restricted to specific lexical items, while the latter affects two contrastive sound categories as a whole.
                    Through the example of Hungarian word-final phonotactics, the Model of Perceptual Categorization associates these two patterns
                    with different functional load and acoustic properties of contrasts, that lead to two categorizational malfunctions. On the one
                    hand, phonotactic vacillation is a result of a frequent failure to categorize ambiguous tokens: low functional load coinciding
                    with little acoustic difference. On the other hand, lexical exceptions are systematic categorizational mistakes brought about by
                    salient categories – in this case distributional generalizations are hindered by interference from mislabeled tokens.

Our paper investigates lexical stress placement variation in Modern Standard Russian past tense verbal forms. This
                    kind of variation has arisen due to complex interactions of various processes in the development of Russian and its present-day
                    state is said (often rather impressionistically) to be conditioned by intra-speaker sociolinguistic factors. However, cases of inter-speaker variation can also be observed. We put forward a proposal that stress placement in forms with
                    variable stress is influenced by the rhythmic pattern of immediate linear context. To support this, we report on a pilot
                    experiment that shows a preference towards alternating rhythm in a sequence consisting of a past tense verbal form of a
                    transitive verb and its direct object, thus conforming to the fundamental principle of rhythmic alternation. The results also
                    raise some questions about the phonology of stress and stress variation in Russian and beyond.

This paper examines the historical and phonological properties of h in Japanese. It shows that,
                    by analysing a specific case of segmental variation, we not only deepen our understanding of the sound which varies but also shed
                    light on some general characteristics of the sound system as a whole. Using an Element Theory approach (Anderson and Jones 1974; Kaye et al. 1985;
                        Harris and Lindsey 1995; Scheer 1999;
                        Nasukawa 2005; Cyran 2010; Backley 2011), the discussion focuses on the distribution of the element |U|, arguing
                    that |U| is naturally weak in Japanese. This helps explain two idiosyncrasies in Japanese phonology – the restricted distribution
                    of labial consonants and rounded vowels, and the patterning of h with labials.
In modern Japanese, labiality is phonologically and phonetically weak. In vowels, u and
                        w are produced without lip rounding, as unrounded [ɯ] and [ɰ]. And in consonants, the labial stop
                        p is banned from certain contexts. These facts point to the inherent weakness of |U| in Japanese, where
                    weakness refers to structural headedness; following Backley and Nasukawa (2009), it is
                    assumed that labials are represented by headed |U| (cf. non-headed |U| in velars). To account for the restricted distribution of
                    labials, it is argued that labiality (headed |U|) is only realised in Japanese if a specific structural
                    condition is met: |U| must co-occur with (i.e. be supported by) another element from the same sub-group of ‘dark’ elements. Thus,
                    the paper exploits the natural division between dark elements {|A|, |U|, |L|} and light elements {|I|, |H|, |Ɂ|}.

The paper deals with the assumed correlation between morphological and syntactic phenomena, especially the one that has its roots in a parametric approach to syntax since (Chomsky 1981). Its main focus is on testing predictions presented in two works (Bobaljik and Thráinsson 1998 and Holmberg 2010a). These papers connect verbal morphology with a clustering of syntactic phenomena in the Scandinavian languages and maintain that morphological evidence – in the form of ‘rich’ verbal agreement – signifies a positive setting of a parameter that in turn makes certain syntactic patterns possible. In the present paper it is shown how this relation works when tested on a group of Ovansiljan vernaculars (East Scandinavian non-standard varieties). Five of these vernaculars have retained verbal agreement in number and person, whereas two others have not. It turns out that the hypotheses encounter difficulties when faced with the Ovansiljan data.

The have yet to construction, exemplified by sentences such as John has yet to visit his
                        grandmother, is widespread across dialects of English. However, recent studies have revealed that behind this
                    apparent unity, there is significant variation in the syntactic properties of the have yet to construction.
                    Speakers vary with respect to (i) the status of have as an auxiliary or main verb, (ii) the status of negation
                    tests, and (iii) the status of a variety of related yet to constructions. The goal of this paper is to sort out
                    the microsyntax of have yet to across speakers, in the face of contradictory empirical claims and mutually
                    incompatible proposals in the existing literature. We develop an analysis based in part on two wide-scale surveys we have
                    conducted. With respect to have, we show that speakers who can treat it as a main verb can also treat it as an
                    auxiliary, but not necessarily vice-versa. We propose that the variation in this case has to do with where the perfect
                    features are introduced in the clause. With respect to negation, we find that speakers do not treat all the negation tests the
                    same, forcing us to contend with the question of how these tests work. We propose that for most speakers, only the embedded clause
                    is syntactically negative. Negation tests split according to whether they must target the matrix clause, or whether they can
                    target an embedded clause as well. In some cases, the tests reveal the same sentence to be both affirmative and negative, as we
                    expect: the matrix clause is syntactically affirmative, but the embedded clause, which hosts the lexical content, is syntactically
                    negative.

                    questions of the type that have also been observed in German. In the context of polar questions, we demonstrate that there are
                    two distinct positions for discourse particles in central and eastern dialects of Basque: one inside the IP/TP-domain and one in
                    the left periphery of the clause. Again, we indicate relevant cross-linguistic parallels, thereby dealing with Basque discourse

Through a focus on the properties of subject-finite verb inversion and XP fronting in three relaxed V2 languages, namely Cimbrian, Ladin and Mòcheno, this paper aims to widen and refine our understanding of relaxed V2 languages, i.e. languages in which the V2 property should be understood in a technical sense as obligatory V-to-C movement, not as a simple description referring to linearisation (Benincà 2006, 2013; Ledgeway 2016). It will be shown that inversion differs across relaxed V2 languages in two ways. In a first subtype, inversion is not associated with any marked pragmatic interpretation of the lexical subject and the subject appears in an A position in the IP area: this type is instantiated by Old Italian (Benincà 2006, Poletto 2014). A second option, instantiated by the languages considered in this paper, is that the lexical subject receives a pragmatically marked interpretation which is encoded in a Functional Projection (FP) in the vP periphery (Belletti 2004, Poletto 2006). This paper confirms that V3/V4 word orders involve the presence of a double articulation for foci and wh-elements, which appear in different positions in the CP layer in relaxed V2 languages (Poletto 2002, Wolfe 2015 a,b). It also contributes to our understanding of the syntax of topics in relaxed V2 languages by showing that (i) topics can be moved to CP and (ii) the movement option is not restricted to main clauses lacking an XP in the left periphery; it also occurs in interrogative clauses (unlike in the relaxed V2 varieties considered in Walkden 2014, 2015).

                    that Old English lacks an embedded split CP and therefore lacks embedded V2 and
                    a host of other embedded root phenomena. I show this to be true for complements
                    to both assertive and non-assertive verbs. In contrast, the Modern English
                    matrix verb has an effect on the strength of the C-position. Assertive verbs in
                    Modern English allow main clause phenomena in subordinate clauses whereas
                    non-assertives typically do not. The main point of the paper is to chronicle the
                    changes that ‘stretch’ the embedded clause and the changing role of main verbs.

                    V2", ,2019,"
Old French is considered by many to have been a verb-second (V2)
                    language. Furthermore, 13th century Old French featured a V2 system with strong
                    restrictions on the prefield, meaning only a single constituent was generally
                    accepted to the left of the finite verb. This bears a strong resemblance to the
                    pattern found in the Modern Germanic V2 languages and has occasionally given
                    rise to suggestions that V2 was a Germanic property inherited from the language
                    of the Franks. In this paper, a concrete hypothesis is developed for the
                    diachronic evolution of Old French V2 from Late Latin. It is argued that the
                    hypothesis of Germanic influence is not necessarily incorrect, but too
                    simplistic, as the two synchronic components of the Old French V2 construction
                    -namely V-to-C movement and restrictions on the prefield – most likely have
                    their own and independent diachronies as well. Comparative and historical
                    evidence is presented to show that V-to-C movement is very unlikely to have been
                    a product of Germanic influence and should rather be considered an internal
                    development from Latin. As for the restricted prefield (so-called ‘linear V2’),
                    the scarcity or even absence of evidence does not allow firm conclusions, but
                    some general theoretical insights from the literature on language change and
                    second language acquisition combine to make the idea of Germanic influence quite
                    plausible.

Our Aromanian data come from Diviakë, Libofshë and Fier, three locations close to one another in southern Albania,

                    finite complementizers, shows that Aromanian supports analyses of complementizers as wh- pronouns independently developed for
                    other Romance languages. Section 3 elaborates a proposal originally put forth for Albanian,
                    where the subjunctive particle is identical to the Linker – namely that the main role of subjunctive particles is introducing a
                    variable EPP argument, subject to control. Section 4 argues that Prepositional introducers of
                    non-finite sentences amount to an obliquization strategy to circumvent Agree Resistance – as does the nominalization
                    (relativization) strategy of Section 2 (and the predication strategy in Section 3).

In this article I analyze the complementizer doubling construction attested in some early and modern Italo-Romance
                    varieties, where a preposed (clausal or non clausal) constituent associated to the selected clause appears in the embedded left
                    periphery preceded and followed by a subordinating complementizer. While the higher complementizer is uncontroversially
                    interpreted as a lexicalization of the head Force°, the lower complementizer has been taken to lexicalize either the functional
                    head Topic° or the functional head Fin°. Relying on previous formal analyses of subject extraction, I argue that in the varieties
                    in which the lower complementizer lexicalizes Fin°, its presence reflects the lexicalization of the mood features encoded by Fin°,
                    and is ultimately due to the extraction of the thematic subject out of the embedded clause through Spec,FinP, a movement strategy
                    made possible by the presence of an expletive pro in the canonical preverbal subject position.

The object of study of this paper is a Romance construction characterized by the presence of the complementizer in
                    root clauses and by an evidential or epistemic meaning (i.e. C-constructions). In these structures, the
                    complementizer is preceded by a functional element that morphologically coincides with an adjective or an adverb. From a
                    morphosyntactic viewpoint, we show that these structures are monoclausal and that the epistemic or evidential item preceding the
                    complementizer has undergone a process of grammaticalization becoming a functional element. As for their use and interpretation,
                    we describe their primary semantic meaning, as well as their pragmatic extensions and functions, which involve subjectification and
                    intersubjectivity. We finally propose a syntactic configuration that can account for C-constructions and their properties in the
                    syntax representation. This configuration involves the assumption of a projection – in fact, a set of projections – above ForceP
                    which encode speaker-oriented and pragmatic features (e.g. evaluative, evidential, epistemic values).

Object markers (OMs) in Bantu languages have long been argued to be either incorporated pronouns or agreement
                    morphemes, distinguished mainly by their ability (or not) to co-occur with (i.e. double) in situ objects. Lubukusu appears to be
                    an instance of OMs-as-incorporated pronouns, as OMs in neutral discourse contexts cannot double in situ objects in a broad range
                    of syntactic contexts. As we show, however, certain pragmatic contexts in fact do license OM-doubling; we demonstrate that
                    OM-doubling in Lubukusu is licit only on a verum (focus) interpretation. We analyze OM-doubling within a Minimalist framework as
                    the result of an Agree relation between the object and a verum-triggering Emphasis head (Emph°). The non-doubling OM results from
                    an incorporation operation. We therefore claim that Lubukusu displays two distinct syntactic derivations of OMs (generating
                    doubling and non-doubling) with the interpretive effects of OM-doubling arising from the semantic/pragmatic properties of
                    Emph°.

The argument DP hypothesis, adopted by many syntactic analyses, claims that nominal arguments are introduced by a determiner (D), which may be covert or overt. While overt D is obligatory in Modern French (consistent with the argument DP hypothesis), it was not obligatory in earlier stages of French. We explore the factors that contributed to this change – including semantic class, syntactic function, number, and definiteness – focusing on a shift that occurred in the D-paradigm in two Anglo-Norman texts of the 12th century. Quantitative analysis (Goldvarb) yields two major findings. First, the effect of syntactic function remains constant: subject position favours overt D, but object position inhibits it. Second, there is a change in the effect of semantic class: count nouns increasingly favour overt D, but non-count (mass and abstract) nouns increasingly inhibit it. More generally, the gradual disappearance of bare Ns in French reflects the emergence of paradigmatically conditioned D.

As an illustration of the usefulness of the TBC, the article presents research on the evolution of the position and interpretation of subjects in Portuguese from the 16th to the 19th century. Two main claims emerge, in response to questions that have largely remained unanswered until now, due to the paucity of available data. One is that the texts of the classical period instantiate verb-movement to Comp in matrix clauses, reflecting a V2 grammar. The other is that quantitative and qualitative changes appearing in the texts of the authors born from the beginning of the 18th century on indicate that, at this period, verb-movement to Comp was lost and the modern SVO grammar emerged.

This contribution presents two syntactically annotated corpora of Old French, Modéliser le changement: les voies du français (MCVF) and the Syntactic Reference Corpus of Medieval French (SRCMF). The focus is on how the underlying syntactic theory (constituency vs. dependency) influences the grammar model and how this choice is reflected in the syntactic annotations of the corpora. The comparison relates to the most relevant general properties of the corpora as well as to two phenomena, null subjects and cleft constructions. Null subjects highlight possible conflicts between syntactic annotation models and syntactic theory, and the information-structural properties of cleft constructions pose a particular problem for the interpretation and annotation of historical corpora. Both phenomena are major instances of diachronic variation in French. The study is relevant for corpus users working on diachronic syntax, as well for corpus builders wishing to design a grammar model for annotation.

The benefits of a comparative corpus approach to contact varieties is illustrated by a case study of a putative verbal calque from the Spanish in Texas data. It is demonstrated that the relative frequency of the verb is much higher than in its source Mexican variety and that the verb selects different complements in Texas than it does in other varieties.

LM/CS in non-naturalistic (e.g., literary) texts raises issues related to gauging (1) the authenticity and representativity of a textual corpus, and deciding (2) whether categories/mechanisms of spoken LM/CS apply to written LM/CS. We focus on Guarani-Spanish LM/CS (Jopara) as represented in the Paraguayan novel Ramona Quebranto (RQ). We apply the framework of Muysken (1997; 2000; 2013), developed as a taxonomy of spoken LM/CS. Our contribution extends its applicability to written LM/CS. We show that Jopara has a mix of insertional and backflagging strategies, with infrequent alternations.

In this paper we argue that verb clusters in Dutch varieties are merged and linearized in fully ascending (1-2-3) or fully descending (3-2-1) orders. We argue that verb clusters that deviate from these orders involve non-verbal material: adjectival participles, or nominal infinitives. As a result, our approach does not involve any unmotivated movements that are specific for verb clusters.
Support for our analysis comes from (i) the interpretation of verb clusters; (ii) the fact that order variation depends on the types of verbs involved, which can be explained by selectional requirements of the verbs; and (iii) the geographic co-occurrence patterns of various orders. First, the 1-3-2 and 3-1-2 orders are argued to be ascending orders with a non-verbal 3. Indeed these orders occur in grammars that have ascending, rather than descending, verb clusters. Secondly, the 1-3-2 order is argued to be an interrupted V1-V2 cluster with a non-verbal 3. Indeed, this order is most common in the region where non-verbal material can interrupt the verb cluster.
Our analysis of word order variation in verb clusters in terms of principles of grammar is further supported by an experiment in which we asked a large number of speakers distributed over the Dutch language area to rank all logically possible orders, including orders that are not common in their own variety of Dutch. The results demonstrate that speakers apply their syntactic knowledge to rank verb cluster orders that they do not use themselves. We argue that this knowledge cannot be due to familiarity with the various orders.

I propose that object drop in RWR is dependent on article drop. I analyze null articles in RWR as the presence of a phonologically null determiner with the semantics of a choice function. To analyze object drop, I adopt Tomioka (2003)’s analysis for Japanese null pronouns, in which a null determiner, combined with NP ellipsis, allows a constituent with pronominal-like semantics to go wholly unpronounced. I argue that a similar process is at work in English RWR, and argue that this analysis allows us to understand the person and expletive restrictions.

Both items need to be licensed by a specific (parsing) strategy known as discourse orientation (Huang, 1984), which is also applicable in the special register of headlines. It is shown that distinguishing between discourse and sentence orientation and correlating these two strategies with λ-binding and existential quantification, respectively, naturally accounts for an asymmetry in article omission observed in Stowell (1991).

The paper develops the cartographic analysis of register based subject omission proposed in Haegeman (2013) and based on Rizzi’s (2006b) ‘Privilege of the Root’ approach.

We present an analysis of Instructional Register Null Objects that also accounts for obligatorily null pronouns in certain radical pro-drop languages like Niuean. In this language, most pronouns are optionally null, however 3rd person inanimate pronouns are obligatorily null. We argue that the obligatorily null nature of such pronouns (whether register-specific like in English, or general as in Niuean) is a result of their lack of φ-features, which leaves them with only the option of being realized through Neeleman & Szendrői’s (2007) general Zero Spell-out Rule.

In this paper, we consider variation in Verb Second (V2) word order in wh-questions across Norwegian dialects by investigating data from the Nordic Syntax Database (NSD), which consists of acceptability judgments collected at more than 100 locations in Norway. We trace the geographical distribution of the two main variables: phrasal vs. monosyllabic wh-elements (the latter argued to be heads) and subject vs. non-subject questions. In subject questions, non-V2 is realized by inserting the complementizer som in second position instead of the verb. We also discuss the connection between non-V2 and the possibility of inserting the complementizer som under extraction of a wh-subject from an embedded clause, i.e. in that-trace contexts. Based on synchronic data, we propose a diachronic account of the geographical distribution and argue that the development from V2 to non-V2 has started in subject questions, thus allowing us to relate the loss of the V2 requirement to changes in the properties of the complementizer som.

In this article we analyze the internal structure of bare universal and negative quantifiers in Italian varieties, taking into consideration both synchronic and diachronic variation. It is proposed that bare quantifiers are not standard QPs with a null DP restrictor, but deficient items where the Q-portion is paired with a classifier expressing the [+/− human]-feature, more specifically a special type of light noun. Items of this type are overtly realized in languages like English and in some Italian varieties. The overt realization of these items appears to be related to the surface position of the QP, as is crucially shown by some varieties that allow both variants. The paper also discusses some cases where these classifiers are still lexically ambiguous between a full noun and a light noun.

Adopting a neoparametric approach, in which a language’s inventory of grammatical features may change over time, we show that a cluster of related surface changes can be accounted for by positing that the feature modality was added to English tense/mood system. While the most immediate manifestation of this change was the grammaticalization of the modals themselves, this in turn altered the system of contrasts in the language: in clauses without modal verbs, the absence of the modal became contrastive, narrowing the range of possible interpretations.

This squib investigates syntactic variation and change in the Degree Phrase (DegP) using three modifiers in the semantic field of ‘different’ as a case study: English different and other and French différent. The squib makes two main claims. The synchronic claim is that these modifiers display extensive microsyntactic variation, spanning a range of positions from A in the DegP to D in the DP. The diachronic claim is that items in this class display a tendency to move to higher syntactic positions in a way that is familiar from better-studied syntactic domains. Data from the DegP is thus compatible with, and useful for, generative theories of syntactic variation and change.

In this article, I argue that the generalization underpinning this variation in Tano concerns a prohibition on wh- items phrasing with C0 at the level of Intonational Phrase (ιP). I show that the ability of a wh- item to appear in-situ correlates with the prosodic status of its immediately containing clause. Embedded complement clauses are parsed as independent ιP units in Krachi and Bono, but not in Wasa and Asante Twi. Thus, ιP boundaries divide C0 from embedded interrogatives in Krachi and Bono, preventing the items from forming a prosodic constituent at the level of ιP. Conversely, no such boundaries intervene between embedded C0 and wh- in Wasa and Asante Twi, yielding prosodic mappings in which the items phrase together. Consequently, embedded wh- in-situ is prosodically licit in Krachi and Bono, but not in Wasa and Asante Twi. In this way, the Tano pattern of wh- in-situ variation described above reduces to a difference in how syntactic structures are externalized via prosodic mapping.

This paper offers novel insights on articlelessness in noun phrases in Dutch and German headlines. Modified noun
					phrases that lack a determiner in headlines exhibit adjectival agreement that cannot be explained if one assumes an article that
					is phonologically null or that has been PF-deleted. We describe the pattern, consider different analytical options and eventually
					conclude that the interpretation, distribution as well as the observed adjectival agreement characteristic of articlelessness noun
					phrases calls for an account in which the article is never projected to begin with.

",2022,"
Besides its main use as a form of the movement verb ir ‘to go’, the Spanish form vaya (lit. go) is also used as a verbal discourse marker. Here we trace this transition from a purely verbal form to a discourse marker by searching a historical corpus of documents in Spanish, which reveals the increasing use over time of vaya in exclamatives to replace a presentational construction. We focus on vaya in isolation and in combination with an indefinite DP or a bare NP. We analyze the meaning of vaya as an epistemic discourse marker, by means of which the speaker expresses a judgment, a subjective epistemic and evidential evaluation of a proposition accessible from context. We postulate that these constructions sit in a Judgment Phrase at the syntactic-pragmatic interface (Krifka 2020), a position to which vaya also moves when its meaning is that of an expressive intensifier that directly modifies over one or more (contextually salient) properties of the noun contained in the DP/NP.

Despite an increasing interest in German dialect syntax, the study of article use in Upper German (Alemannic and
					Bavarian) remains a desideratum. This is true in particular for Austrian varieties. The present study focusses on article
					variation and change in Austrian Upper German and discusses the status of article grammaticalization. To that effect, ‘radical’
					cases of article use in Upper German are analysed, i.e. cases considered incorrect in standard German: the use of indefinite
					articles before mass nouns, of definite articles before proper nouns, and of indefinite articles in the plural. These phenomena
					are investigated by means of a comprehensive dialect survey (3,599 dialect translations by 163 dialect speakers from 40 research
					locations). The analysis examines inner-linguistic factors (lexis, semantics, syntax) as well as extra-linguistic factors (dialect
					areas, age group). The findings reveal a surprisingly high variability and a relatively advanced stage of grammaticalization in
					some areas, especially Central Bavarian dialects.

",2022,"
This article sketches a new analysis of the diachronic development found in many West Germanic languages from a
					hybrid VO-OV order to a rigid OV or VO order. The discussion departs from the discussions in Struik & Van Kemenade (2020/2022) and Struik & Schoenmakers (to appear) on the diachronic development of English/Dutch, which focus on the
					role of object shift and information structure. My interpretation of their data will be based on an earlier analysis of the
					Germanic OV and VO languages in Broekhuis (2008: § 2.4; 2011). The main conclusions are the following. First, the change from the historical hybrid VO-OV systems
				    to the rigid OV and VO systems of the present-day languages is due to changing the “setting” [±V‑to‑v] to the
					more categorical ones [−V-to-v] or [+V-to-v]. Second, the role of object shift in the diachronic
					development is modest; it is not involved in the development of the OV-languages at all and involves only the (partial) loss of
					object shift in the VO-languages (contra Struik et al.). Third, the encoding of the information-structural
						new-given distinction remains constant in that the interpretation of (un)scrambled nominal objects does not
					change over time (contra Struik & Schoenmakers).

", ,2022,"
The second person pronouns in Spanish have exhibited numerous variants along its history, not only regarding its stressed forms, but also the agreement that emerges in the inflecting elements that anchor these stressed pronouns. Despite the quantity of studies carried out about voseo, tuteo and ustedeo, none of them has argued what grammatical reasons underlie for so much variation, since they have focused on pragmatic and sociolinguistic patterns without going any further than a mere description. In this article, I aim to account for the linguistic features that have triggered all variants and person disagreements, for every case has undergone the same grammatical process.
